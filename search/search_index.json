To use OpenSSH you must  first start a terminal program on your computer.  On OS X the standard terminal is called Terminal, and it is installed by default.  On Linux there are many popular terminal programs including: xterm, gnome-terminal, konsole (if you aren't sure, then xterm is a good  default).  When you've started the terminal you should see a command prompt.  To log into *barcoo*, for example, type this command at  the prompt and press return (where the word *username* is replaced with your *barcoo* username):  *$ ssh username@barcoo.vlsci.org.au*  The same procedure works for any other machine where you have an account except that if your Unix computer uses a port other than 22 you will need to specify the port by adding the option *-p PORT* with PORT substituted with the port number.  You may be presented with a message along the lines of:  <pre><code>The authenticity of host 'barcoo.vlsci.org.au (131.172.36.150)' can't be  established.\n...\nAre you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?\n</code></pre>  Although you should never ignore a warning, this particular one is nothing to be concerned about; type **yes** and then **press enter**.  If all goes well you will be asked to enter your password.  Assuming you type the correct username and password the system should  then display a welcome message, and then present you with a Unix prompt.  If you get this far then you are ready to start entering  Unix commands and thus begin using the remote computer.   Windows  On Microsoft Windows (Vista, 7, 8) we recommend that you use the PuTTY ssh client.  PuTTY (putty.exe) can be downloaded  from this web page:  [http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html)  Documentation for using PuTTY is here:  [http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/docs.html](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/docs.html)  When you start PuTTY you should see a window which looks something like this:    To connect to *barcoo* you should enter *barcoo.vlsci.org.au* into the box entitled \"Host Name (or IP address)\"  and *22* in the port,  then click on the Open button. All of the settings should remain the same as they were when PuTTY started (which should be the  same as they are in the picture above).  In some circumstances you will be presented with a window entitled PuTTY Security Alert. It will say something along the lines  of *\"The server's host key is not cached in the registry\"*. This is nothing to worry about, and you should agree to continue (by  clicking on Yes). You usually see this message the first time you try to connect to a particular remote computer.  If all goes well, a terminal window will open, showing a prompt with the text *\"login as:\"*. An example terminal window is shown  below. You should type your *barcoo* username and press enter. After entering your username you will be prompted for your  password. Assuming you type the correct username and password the system should then display a welcome message, and then  present you with a Unix prompt.

The other transcript variants all express the same exons encoding the extracellular domain of the receptor (shown in the fugure here in green) but have truncated intracellular domains, which do not include the tyrosine kinase domain and thus activate different signalling pathways upon binding to BDNF.  None of these truncated protein products have been well studied, but the most highly expressed receptor variant is known as TrkB-T1, and is known to be highly expressed in astocytes.  </p> <p>Since the transcript variants are differently expressed in different cell types within the CNS the NTRK2 gene is a very useful example for exploring cell type specific transcript expression in available public data.</p> <p> Major CNS cell types:</p> <p> </p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Neuron (yellow cell in the image)</li> <li>Astrocyte  </li> <li>Oligodendrocyte  </li> <li>Microglia  </li> <li>Ependymal  </li> </ul> <p></p>"},{"location":"tutorials/Genome_browsers/GenomeBrowsers_Intro/#section-1-introduction-to-genome-browsers","title":"Section 1: Introduction to Genome Browsers","text":"<p>Genome browsers rely on a common reference genome for each species in order to map data from different sources to the correct location.

TrkB is an important receptor that binds extracellular BDNF and propagates the intracellular signalling response via a tyrosine kinase. This TrkB receptor protein is encoded by the NTRK2 gene.  </p> <p>The NRK2 gene expresses a number of different transcript variants in different cell types. The most well studied of these is the full length TrkB receptor referred to as TrkB, which is mainly expressed in neuronal cell types. The other transcript variants all express the same exons encoding the extracellular domain of the receptor (shown in the fugure here in green) but have truncated intracellular domains, which do not include the tyrosine kinase domain and thus activate different signalling pathways upon binding to BDNF.  None of these truncated protein products have been well studied, but the most highly expressed receptor variant is known as TrkB-T1, and is known to be highly expressed in astocytes.  </p> <p>Since the transcript variants are differently expressed in different cell types within the CNS the NTRK2 gene is a very useful example for exploring cell type specific transcript expression in available public data.</p> <p>Major CNS cell types:</p> <ul> <li>Neuron  (yellow cell in the image below)</li> <li>Astrocyte  </li> <li>Oligodendrocyte  </li> <li>Microglia  </li> <li>Ependymal  </li> </ul> <p></p>"},{"location":"tutorials/Genome_browsers/GenomeBrowsers_Intro_short/#section-1-introduction-to-genome-browsers","title":"Section 1: Introduction to Genome Browsers","text":"<p>Genome browsers rely on a common reference genome for each species in order to map data from different sources to the correct location.

Therefore it is very important to know which version of the genome your data of interest is aligned to.</p> <p>The sequence for the human reference genome was accumulated up over many years from sequence data from many different sources and does not represent the sequence of one single person. Instead it is a composite of fragments of the genome from many different people.  Also, unlike the human genome which is diploid, the human genome is haploid.  That is there is only one copy of each chromosome. It therefore does not reflect the variation on the population, or even the most common variants in the human genome.

De novo genome assemblies assume no prior knowledge of the source DNA sequence length, layout or composition. In a genome sequencing project, the DNA of the target organism is broken up into millions of small pieces and read on a sequencing machine. These \u201creads\u201d vary from 20 to 1000 nucleotide base pairs (bp) in length depending on the sequencing method used.  Typically for Illumina type short read sequencing, reads of length 36 - 150 bp are produced. These reads can be either \u201csingle ended\u201d as described above or \u201cpaired end.\u201d A good summary of other types of DNA sequencing can be found here.</p> <p>Paired end reads are produced when the fragment size used in the sequencing process is much longer (typically 250 - 500 bp long) and the ends of the fragment are read in towards the middle. This produces two \u201cpaired\u201d reads. One from the left hand end of a fragment and one from the right with a known separation distance between them. (The known separation distance is actually a distribution with a mean and standard deviation as not all original fragments are of the same length.) This extra information contained in the paired end reads can be useful for helping to tie pieces of sequence together during the assembly process.</p> <p>The goal of a sequence assembler is to produce long contiguous pieces of sequence (contigs) from these reads. The contigs are sometimes then ordered and oriented in relation to one another to form scaffolds. The distances between pairs of a set of paired end reads is useful information for this purpose.</p> <p>The mechanisms used by assembly software are varied but the most common type for short reads is assembly by de Bruijn graph. See this document for an explanation of the de Bruijn graph genome assembler \u201cVelvet.\u201d</p> <p>Genome assembly is a very difficult computational problem, made more difficult because many genomes contain large numbers of identical sequences, known as repeats. These repeats can be thousands of nucleotides long, and some occur in thousands of different locations, especially in the large genomes of plants and animals.

Introduction","text":"<p>Expected time: 40 minutes.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/git/git/#what-is-git","title":"What is Git?","text":"<p>A concise definition is that Git is a version control system. It was developed in the early 2000s by  Linus Torvalds, the person behind the Linux kernel, and other members of the Linux community. In fact, the initial purpose of Git was to support the development and updates of the Linux kernel.</p> <p>Git is attractive because of several things:</p> <ul> <li>It is fully distributed. What this means is that several (hundreds, thousands) of users can work on the same project in a streamlined way.</li> <li>It is blazing fast. Because (nearly) every operation that Git performs is local, everything works almost instantaneously.</li> <li>It has integrity. Git checksums data before storing it, so it\u2019s impossible to change the content of files without knowing about it.</li> </ul> <p>This is all well and good, but let\u2019s try to understand what version control means for us as researchers.</p> <p></p> <p>\u201cnotFinal.doc\u201d by Jorge Cham, https://www.phdcomics.com</p> <p>We\u2019ve all been in this situation before: it seems unnecessary to have multiple nearly-identical versions of the same document. Some word processors let us deal with this a little better, such as Microsoft Word\u2019s Track Changes, Google Docs\u2019 version history, or LibreOffice\u2019s Recording and Displaying Changes.</p> <p>Version control systems start with a base version of the document and then record changes you make each step of the way. You can think of it as a recording of your progress: you can rewind to start at the base document and play back each change you made, eventually arriving at your more recent version.</p> <p></p> <p>Once you think of changes as separate from the document itself, you can then think about \u201cplaying back\u201d different sets of changes on the base document, ultimately resulting in different versions of that document. For example, two users can make independent sets of changes on the same document.</p> <p></p> <p>Unless multiple users make changes to the same section of the document - a  conflict - you can incorporate two sets of changes into the same base document.</p> <p></p> <p>A version control system is a tool that keeps track of these changes for us, effectively creating different versions of our files. It allows us to decide which changes will be made to the next version (each record of these changes is called a commit, and keeps useful metadata about them. The complete history of commits for a particular project and their metadata make up a repository. Repositories can be kept in sync across different computers, facilitating collaboration among different people.</p> The Long History of Version Control Systems <p>Automated version control systems are nothing new. Tools like RCS, CVS, or Subversion have been around since the early 1980s and are used by many large companies. However, many of these are now considered legacy systems (i.e., outdated) due to various limitations in their capabilities. More modern systems, such as Git and Mercurial, are distributed, meaning that they do not need a centralized server to host the repository. These modern systems also include powerful merging tools that make it possible for multiple authors to work on the same files concurrently.</p> <p>Paper Writing</p> <ul> <li> <p>Imagine you drafted an excellent paragraph for a paper you are writing, but later ruin it. How would you retrieve the excellent version of your conclusion? Is it even possible?</p> </li> <li> <p>Imagine you have 5 co-authors. How would you manage the changes and comments they make to your paper? If you use LibreOffice Writer or Microsoft Word, what happens if you accept changes made using the <code>Track Changes</code> option? Do you have a history of those changes?</p> </li> </ul> Solution <ul> <li> <p>Recovering the excellent version is only possible if you created a copy of the old version of the paper. The danger of losing good versions often leads to the problematic workflow illustrated in the PhD Comics cartoon at the top of this page.</p> </li> <li> <p>Collaborative writing with traditional word processors is cumbersome. Either every collaborator has to work on a document sequentially (slowing down the process of writing), or you have to send out a version to all collaborators and manually merge their comments into your document. The \u2018track changes\u2019 or \u2018record changes\u2019 option can highlight changes for you and simplifies merging, but as soon as you accept changes you will lose their history. You will then no longer know who suggested that change, why it was suggested, or when it was merged into the rest of the document. Even online word processors like Google Docs or Microsoft Office Online do not fully resolve these problems.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Keypoints</p> <ul> <li>Version control is like an unlimited \u2018undo\u2019.</li> <li>Version control also allows many people to work in parallel.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tutorials/git/git/#why-use-version-control","title":"Why use version control?","text":"<p>Now that we\u2019ve learned what version control is, let\u2019s understand why we should use it as researchers.</p> <p>There are a number of reasons to argue that using version control will make us better researchers. That is because  version control systems can be used for:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Backing up your code The most fundamental idea of version control is that you can use it to safely back up your code. That means not only having a copy of it, but having a copy of each version as your code evolves throughout time. If you use version control effectively, it will be very difficult for your code to be permanently lost, deleted or erased.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sharing your code Although Git is already explicitly designed to work in a distributed manner, modern version control platforms make sharing code with others even easier. If our repository is public, anyone can easily access it, copy, and modify the code as they please. You can make your GitHub profile a portfolio of your coding and analysis projects, with a user-friendly interface.</p> <p>Packaging and distribution</p> <p>Platforms such as GitHub provide a number of features that facilitate packaging our code. One thing is to have a bunch of scripts in a repository, but if we want to distribute our code effectively, to make it easier for users to acquire and install our code, we can bundle it as a software package and upload it to platforms such as PyPI (for Python) or CRAN (for R).</p> </li> <li> <p>Collaborating Sharing code with others is one thing, but Git also enables researchers to work together on the same project. You can review other users\u2019 commits, and selectively apply or reject changes that they propose. This is further enabled by GitHub, which makes it easy to do it through the web interface. Moreover, you can create organisations to host multiple projects, give collaborators write and admin access to projects, and give access to private repositories.</p> <p>The \u2018Lingua Franca\u2019 of software engineering</p> <p>Because of the way Git enables collaboration, it has essentially become the way that programmers interact on a technical basis. If you want to make a contribution to a large code base or project, most likely you will have to submit your changes through Git. GitHub also allows the creation of issues, where you can report problems or create discussions about the code. Knowing Git will probably be required if you want to work in coding projects with other people (including past and future you!)</p> </li> <li> <p>Documenting your work Because changes in Git are structured through commits, it is very straightforward to document our work as we go. Whenever we create a commit, we must write a message that\u2019s attached to it (we\u2019ll learn more about that), which almost mandates that we document what we are doing. This will create a history of our work which can effectively be used as a digital research notebook if done correctly. The way Git works also allows the creation of branches and tags, which can be used to keep track of different parts of the development. This is especially useful for large projects where many people may be working on different things in parallel.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Keypoints</p> <p>Why Git will make you a better researcher:</p> <ul> <li>You know you can always go back to a working version of your code</li> <li>You will have a way of showcasing your projects</li> <li>You will be able to distribute your code to others</li> <li>You will be able to modify other peoples\u2019 code and make contributions to it</li> <li>You will have a digital lab notebook </li> </ul>"},{"location":"tutorials/git/git/#fundamental-concepts","title":"Fundamental concepts","text":"<p>Before we get started with hands-on work, let\u2019s understand some basic concepts about Git.

While you have your project on your local computer, a remote is a version stored on platforms like GitHub or GitLab. Remotes allow multiple people to work on the same project, sharing updates by pushing changes to the remote and pulling others\u2019 changes from it. For example, you can push your work to a remote to back it up or collaborate with teammates by pulling their changes into your local project.</p> <p>Staging area The staging area in Git is like a \u201cwaiting room\u201d for changes you want to commit. When you modify files, those changes don\u2019t go directly into a commit. Instead, you first add them to the staging area, where you can review and decide what will be included in your next commit. It gives you control to commit only specific changes rather than everything at once. Think of it as preparing ingredients on the counter before putting them into a recipe\u2014you only add what you need.</p> <p></p> <p>Keypoints</p> <ul> <li>Commits are snapshots of a repository.</li> <li>We can have a copy of our repository in a different location, called a remote. We can send (\u201cpush\u201d) and receive (\u201cpull\u201d) changes from the remote to interact with others\u2019 work, and also to back up or update our local copy.</li> <li>The staging area is where we keep track of the changes that we are going to commit, that is, which are going to be written in the repository history.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tutorials/git/git/#2-your-first-git-repository","title":"2. Your first Git repository","text":"<p>Now that we\u2019ve learned the basics of version control, and reasons to use it, let\u2019s get some hands-on experience on how to create our first Git repository.</p> <p>Let\u2019s start navigating to the Documents folder and creating a new directory there.</p> <pre><code>cd\ncd Documents\nmkdir gitgood\ncd gitgood\n</code></pre> <p>Now that you\u2019re in the new <code>gitgood</code> directory, we can start a new repository with the following command:</p> <pre><code>git init\n</code></pre> <p>You should see a message like this:</p> <pre><code>Initialized empty Git repository in /home/username/Documents/gitgood/.git/\n</code></pre> <p>If we try to list the files in the repository, we can\u2019t see anything. Try again with the <code>-a</code> option:</p> <pre><code># This doesn't show anything\nls\n\n# This shows the following\nls -a\n</code></pre> <pre><code>. .. .git\n</code></pre> <p>We can see that we have created the <code>.git</code> directory. This hidden directory (hidden files and directories start with <code>.</code> character) will contain the Git repository, with all of the data that will be read and written by Git. If we delete this directory, we will lose all of the version control data stored by Git.</p> <p>Hidden Files</p> <p>Based on your previous knowledge of UNIX command line, try answering the following:     1. Why did the first <code>ls</code> command did not show anything?     2. What does the <code>-a</code> mean when we run <code>ls</code>?     3. If we don\u2019t know what the <code>-a</code>, or any other command flags mean, how can we find out?     4. What do the <code>.</code> and <code>..</code> files mean?</p> Solution <ol> <li>By default, <code>ls</code> does not display hidden files (starting with a <code>.</code> character). The <code>.git</code> directory hidden by default when we create it.  </li> <li><code>-a</code> shows all of the files and directories, including hidden ones.  </li> <li>If we don\u2019t know what a command-line flag means, we can try looking for the command in the man pages, for example by typing <code>man ls</code>.  </li> <li>The <code>.</code> and <code>..</code> files respectively refer to the current directory and the directory one level above (the <code>Documents</code>, in this case).</li> </ol> <p>We can now try one of the most important Git commands, which tells us the current state of our repository:</p> <pre><code>git status\n</code></pre> <pre><code>On branch main\n\nNo commits yet\n\nnothing to commit (create/copy files and use \"git add\" to track)\n</code></pre> <p>We can use <code>git status</code> as much as we want to check the state of the repository. In this case, there isn\u2019t anything very interesting, but once we start accumulating changes, it will become very useful.</p> <p>Nested directories</p> <p>Once we have run <code>git init</code> on a directory, there is no need to run it again in subdirectories of the original directory. That\u2019s why we should run the command on the parent directory of the project, and we can include additional subdirectories as needed.</p> <p>Keypoints</p> <ul> <li><code>git init</code> initializes a repository.</li> <li>Git stores all of its repository data in the <code>.git</code> directory.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tutorials/git/git/#tracking-changes","title":"Tracking changes","text":"<p>We have successfully created a repository (yay!) so let\u2019s start making some changes so we understand how version control works. At the moment, our repository is completely empty (with exception of the <code>.git</code> directory), so can create a few files to get started.</p> <p>Any code project should have a README file, which, at the very least, should provide a brief overview of the contents of that project directory. Even though our directory is empty, we can get started with a README file:</p> <pre><code>touch README.md\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>touch</code> command creates an empty file. We will be formatting our README file in Markdown. If you haven\u2019t heard of Markdown, basically it\u2019s a simple, easy-to-use language markup language which GitHub fully supports.</p> Markdown Primer <p>Markdown files are plain text files. Even though Markdown has a range of features (such as acting as an extension of HTML), we can stick to the basics:  </p> <ul> <li><code>#</code> creates Level 1 Headings (usually the page title).</li> <li><code>##</code> creates Level 2 Headings (usually the different sections in the page).</li> <li>Subsequent Heading levels can be created with <code>###</code>, <code>####</code>, etc.</li> <li>Backticks (``) create  <code>mono-spaced text, useful for formatting code.</code></li> <li>** Bold text is written with double-asterisks. **</li> <li>*Italics is written with a single-asterisk.*</li> </ul> <p>Now open <code>README.md</code> on your favourite text editor, such as VS Code, nano, Vim, or good old Notepad, and let\u2019s add some content (we recommend that you use VS Code):</p> <pre><code>nano README.md\n</code></pre> <p>Add the following content:</p> <pre><code># 'gitgood' repository\n\nA repository to learn how to use Git.\n</code></pre> <p>If you type in <code>git status</code> and see what it shows:</p> <pre><code>git status\n</code></pre> <pre><code>On branch main\n\nNo commits yet\n\nUntracked files:\n  (use \"git add &lt;file&gt;...\" to include in what will be committed)\n        README.md\n\nnothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\n</code></pre> <p>It\u2019s similar to what we had the first time, but we can see that it showed an untracked file. Git has detected that a new file has been created, but it\u2019s not performing any version control for it. We must first commit this file to our repository. Let\u2019s do so by using two fundamental Git commands:</p> <pre><code>git add README.md\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>git add &lt;FILENAME&gt;</code> command adds a file to the staging area. We learned in the previous section that the staging area is where we store the changes that we intend to commit to the repository. We can see the effect that this has on the repository by typing <code>git status</code> again:</p> <pre><code>git status\n</code></pre> <pre><code>On branch main\n\nNo commits yet\n\nChanges to be committed:\n  (use \"git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;...\" to unstage)\n        new file:   README.md\n</code></pre> <p>Depending on the version of Git you have, the output may be slightly different. But the main things is that this change, that is, of creating a new file, has been staged, and is now ready to be committed. Therefore, the <code>git add</code> command is used to add files to the staging area. Now that these changes area ready to be committed, we can move on with the next command:</p> <p><pre><code>git commit -m \"Add repository README\"\n</code></pre> <pre><code>[main (root-commit) 62a9ebb] Add repository README\n 1 file changed, 4 insertions(+)\n create mode 100644 README.md\n</code></pre></p> <p>The <code>git commit</code> command effectively records the changes that we made and added to the staging area into the repository history. Now, we\u2019ve created another snapshot of the repository, one that has the changes that we\u2019ve made, compared to the previous one where the repository was empty.</p> <p>Commit Messages</p> <p>The <code>-m</code> in the <code>git commit</code> command means <code>--message</code>, that is, the message associated with that particular commit. You should always write descriptive messages of what has been done in a particular commit. </p> <p>After all, one of the reasons of why Git is so powerful and adopted is that it allows you to document your work as you go, and this is largely done by writing (good) commit messages. This may seem a bit excessive at first, such as having to write something everytime you press \u201cSave\u201d on a Word document, but as your project grows and you add more and more code to it, it\u2019s important to be able to see what has been done in each commit. You can also just type <code>git commit</code> without the <code>-m</code>, in this case a text editor will pop up in the Terminal prompting you to write a commit message. </p> <p>We will learn how to write good commit messages later on in this lesson. But basically we want to describe what we changed and why we changed it.</p> <p>Now that we have made our first commit, let\u2019s check the <code>git status</code> again:</p> <pre><code>git status\n</code></pre> <pre><code>On branch main\nnothing to commit, working tree clean\n</code></pre> <p>The message is a bit different than before. Now, we don\u2019t see <code>No commits yet</code>, but rather, that we don\u2019t have anything to commit. That is because we haven\u2019t changed anything in the repository since our last commit.</p> Repository History <p>Now that we have a commit, we can learn a new command:</p> <pre><code>git log\n</code></pre> <pre><code>commit 62a9ebbef3d7a9e0e07f2344a86f10fa58e7479c (HEAD -&gt; main)\nAuthor: Vini Salazar &lt;17276653+vinisalazar@users.noreply.github.com&gt;\nDate:   Mon Sep 9 14:58:43 2024 +1000\n\n    Add repository README\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>git log</code> command shows a list of our commits. We can see the commit checksum (the long code after the word <code>commit</code>), the associated author and email, which is the same user name and email that we set up with <code>git config</code> earlier, the timestamp of the commit, and the commit message. The <code>git log</code> command is useful to get an understanding of recent activity in the repository.</p> <p>Let\u2019s modify the <code>README.md</code> file again and add some new lines:</p> <pre><code># 'gitgood' repository                                                                              \n\nA repository to learn how to use Git.\n\n## Section 1\nHow to git good at version control.\n</code></pre> <p>We\u2019ve added the <code>## Section 1</code> which will represent a new section of text in our Markdown document, and added a little bit of normal text underneath it.</p> <p>Let\u2019s see how this affects our repository by running <code>git status</code> again:</p> <p><pre><code>git status\n</code></pre> <pre><code>On branch main\nChanges not staged for commit:\n  (use \"git add &lt;file&gt;...\" to update what will be committed)\n  (use \"git restore &lt;file&gt;...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n        modified:   README.md\n\nno changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")\n</code></pre></p> <p>Now that Git is keeping track of <code>README.md</code>, any changes that we make to the file will be tracked, so Git knows that we modified the file and added some lines to it. The same goes for when we delete lines from a file. </p> <p>Untracked Files</p> <p>Git will only detect differences in files which have been previously committed to the history. If the file is untracked, like <code>README.md</code> was before our first commit, Git will not record any changes. Be mindful of this, because if you make changes to untracked files, you may not be able to revert them to a previous version!</p> <p>The <code>git status</code> command shows that <code>README.md</code> was modified, but let\u2019s have a look at what specific changes happened. We can do this by running a new command:</p> <pre><code>git diff\n</code></pre> <pre><code>diff --git a/README.md b/README.md\nindex 24e122d..e96d76a 100644\n--- a/README.md\n+++ b/README.md\n@@ -2,3 +2,5 @@\n\n A repository to learn how to use Git.\n\n+## Section 1\n+How to git good at version control.\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>git diff</code> command shows the specific lines that have been changed.

Here, we will use the <code>git reset</code> command:</p> <pre><code>git reset --soft HEAD~1\n</code></pre> <p>There\u2019s a lot to unpack here. First is the <code>git reset</code> command itself. What it does is that it resets the current state of the repository, also called <code>HEAD</code>, to a specified state. In this case, we are resetting to one commit before the current state, hence <code>HEAD~1</code>. The <code>--soft</code> flag tells the command to undo the commit, but keep the changes in the staged area. Let\u2019s run <code>git status</code> to see what it shows:</p> <pre><code>git status\n</code></pre> <pre><code>On branch main\nYour branch is behind 'origin/main' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded.\n  (use \"git pull\" to update your local branch)\n\nChanges to be committed:\n  (use \"git restore --staged &lt;file&gt;...\" to unstage)\n        modified:   python_gc_content.py\n</code></pre> <p>The changes from the commit that we reset are staged, but the commit itself was undone (you can see with <code>git log</code>).

However, because that change is staged, the code remains broken. We can undo the staged change by running:</p> <pre><code>git restore --staged &lt;file&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>This removes the file from the staging area, but the change is still there (you can check it using <code>git status</code>).</p> <p>To fully restore the file to its previous state, you can run:</p> <pre><code>git restore &lt;file&gt;\n</code></pre> Git reset alternatives <p>Running these two commands, that is, to unstage and restore the changes after <code>git reset</code>, would be the equivalent of running:</p> <pre><code>git reset --hard HEAD~1\n</code></pre> <p>In this case, using the <code>--hard</code> flag undoes all of the changes from the current state (the <code>HEAD</code>) to the specified state (in this case, one commit previous to the <code>HEAD</code>). The reason we may want to use <code>--soft</code> instead of <code>--hard</code> is that sometimes we may not want to lose all of our uncommitted changes, but rather review them on a case-by-base basis.</p> <p>Another thing we could do is:</p> <pre><code>git checkout HEAD~1\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>git checkout</code> command is use to transition between branches. We haven\u2019t gone into the concept of branches yet so we will leave this one alone for now.

Let\u2019s try the second approach, of fixing the change ourselves in a new commit. First, let\u2019s undo what we did by running <code>git reset</code>. By doing that, we moved to a previous commit in time. That means that our local copy is one commit behind the remote. So, we can go back to the broken version simply by running:</p> <pre><code>git pull\n</code></pre> <p>This will sync the remote with the local.</p> <p>Now, try perfoming the fix yourself.

Tips and best practices","text":"<p>Well done!</p> <p>By following these steps, you\u2019ve learned the fundamentals of version control with Git.</p> <p>Next up, let\u2019s look at some tips and best practices to incorporate Git into your day-to-day work.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/git/git/#how-to-incorporate-git-in-your-day-to-day-work","title":"How to incorporate Git in your day-to-day work","text":"<p>Adopting Git for beginners can be daunting at first. There are many commands to learn, it requires constant interaction with the command line, and instead of just pressing \u201cSave\u201d, or \u201cCtrl+S\u201d, you have to type in a message everytime you want to record your work. However, there are strategies to mitigate or circumvent these problems.</p> <p>One of them is to think of Git as a digital research notebook. Even if you\u2019re not doing full-blown software engineering, but rather just recording a data analysis project, Git is very useful in the sense that you can document your work as you execute it. Every time you commit a change, you are creating a structured record of that change, which is appropriate for data compliance requirements in most scenarios. By using Git to record your work, you are not only guaranteeing that you will have a back up of your code and the possibility of reverting specific changes if something breaks, but also creating a digital notebook of the what you have done. By thinking of Git like this, you can build up a habit of, for example, committing your work at the end of each day, describing what you have done, much like you would don on a laboratory notebook.</p> <p>The second strategy to take advantage of existing solutions to use Git. This could mean plugins for your IDE, the GitHub Desktop client, or other services like GitKraken. Git is a well-established software with many, many tools that support. Take advantage of that instead of struggling with the Git command-line.</p> <p>The third strategy is to, at the very least, to think of Git as a backup tool. Even though you may create backups of your code in platforms like Dropbox or Google Drive, you would have to sync your backups regularly in other to keep track of an evolving code base. By using Git, you can rest assured that you will have a cloud backup of your code, and you can rely on it in case your local machine stops working.</p> When to commit? <p>It is common for Git beginners to not know exactly when to commit their changes. Since commits can be seen as \u201ccheckpoints\u201d, a good time to commit changes is when things are working as intended. Are you trying to fix a bug, and the error message changed? Even though the code is not fully working, that may be worth a commit to record that you are on the right track. When you fix the code for certain, it is definitely worth a commit! Don\u2019t wait until things break again, because if you haven\u2019t committed your changes when the code was working, you won\u2019t be able to revert back to it. If you are making big changes to a file, such as writing large chunks of documentation, you can split your commits into different sections. For example, commit after you have finished drafting the Introduction, and then again after you\u2019ve finished drafting the Methodology. You can make additional commits later when you are reviewing and editing your text.</p> <p>When you\u2019re first starting with some new code or making fast progress on a project, you don\u2019t have to commit every single line of code (although this may be required if you\u2019re submitting changes to a large code base!).

The slides are available if you would like.  </p> <p>Additionally the following reference material is available for later use:</p> Reference Material   ### What is an HPC?  An HPC is simply a large collection of server-grade computers working together to solve large problems.  * **Big**: HPCs typically have lots of CPUs and Memory and consequently large jobs. * **Shared**: There are usually lots of users making use of it at one time. * **Coordinated**: There is a coordinator program to ensure fair-use between its users. * **Compute Collection**: HPCs use a number of computers at once to solve lots of large jobs.    **Figure**: The user (face at top) interacts with their local PC/Laptop through the keyboard and screen.  The PC/Laptop will  connect to the Head/Login node of the HPC interactively.  The Head/Login node will send the jobs off to the Compute Nodes when one is available.   ### Why use HPCs?  The main reason we use HPCs is because they are quite big.  Given their size, they are usually very expensive, however through  sharing the resources the per user/job cost can be kept low.  * **Many CPUs**: HPCs typically have hundreds to tens of thousands of CPUs.  Compare this with the 4 or 8 that your PC/Laptop might have. * **Large Memory**: Hundreds of GBs to multiple TBs of RAM are typical for each node. * **Efficient use**: Through sharing the resources each user can have access to a very large computer for a period and hand  it back for others to use later.   ### Software Modules  There are typically hundreds to thousands of software packages installed on an HPC.  Given that each can have its own special  requirements and multiple versions will be made, software on the HPC will most commonly be packaged and only made available  to you when you request it.  * **Packaged**: to avoid conflicts between software, each is packaged up into a module and only used on demand. * **Loadable**: before using a software module you need to load it. * **Versions**: given not all users want to use the same version of software (and to compare new results with old you might     need the same version)    each version is made into its own software module so you have ultimate control.  ### Job Submission  Job Submission is the process of instructing the HPC to perform a task for you.  Depending on the HPC software installed on  your HPC, the process of doing so might be different.  * **SLURM**: this workshop uses an HPC that uses the SLURM HPC software.  Some common alternatives (not covered) are PBS or     SGE/OGE. * **Queues (Partition)**: when a job is submitted it is added to a work queue; in SLURM this is called a Partition. * **Batch**: HPC jobs are not 'interactive'.  By this we mean, you can't type input into your job's programs and you won't     immediately see the output that your program prints on the screen.   #### Resources  So that SLURM knows how to schedule and fit jobs around each other, you need to specify what resources your job will use. That is, you need to tell it how many CPUs, RAM, Nodes (servers), and Time you need.  1. **CPUs**: most software is limited using 1 CPU by default but many can use more than one (or you can run multiple copies at once).    The number of CPUs you specify needs to match how many things your software can do at once. 2. **Memory**: you need to estimate (or guess) how much memory (RAM) your program needs. 3. **Nodes**: most software will only use one of the HPC's Nodes (i.e. one server), but some software can make use of more than    one to solve the problem sooner. 4. **Time**: like when you are scheduling meetings, SLURM needs to know how long each job will take (maximum) so it can organise    other jobs afterwards.  #### Job Types  There are two types of jobs that you can submit:  1. **Shared**: a shared job (as the name suggests) is one that shares a node with other jobs.  This is the default and preferred method. 2. **Exclusive**: an exclusive job gets a single (or multiple) nodes to itself.  Given this exclusivity, this type of job must know how     to use multiple CPUs as most HPCs have at least 16 CPUs per node."},{"location":"tutorials/hpc/hpc/#connecting-to-the-hpc","title":"Connecting to the HPC","text":"<p>To begin this workshop you will need to connect to the HPC. Today we will use barcoo. The computer called barcoo.vlsci.org.au is the one that coordinates all the HPC\u2019s tasks.</p> <p>Server details:</p> <ul> <li>host: barcoo.vlsci.org.au</li> <li>port: 22</li> <li>username: (provided at workshop)</li> <li>password: (provided at workshop)</li> </ul> <p>Connection instructions:</p> Mac OS X / Linux  Both Mac OS X and Linux come with a version of ssh (called OpenSSH) that can be used from the command line.  To use OpenSSH you must  first start a terminal program on your computer.  On OS X the standard terminal is called Terminal, and it is installed by default.  On Linux there are many popular terminal programs including: xterm, gnome-terminal, konsole (if you aren't sure, then xterm is a good  default).  When you've started the terminal you should see a command prompt.  To log into *barcoo*, for example, type this command at  the prompt and press return (where the word *username* is replaced with your *barcoo* username):  *$ ssh username@barcoo.vlsci.org.au*  The same procedure works for any other machine where you have an account except that if your Unix computer uses a port other than 22 you will need to specify the port by adding the option *-p PORT* with PORT substituted with the port number.  You may be presented with a message along the lines of:  <pre><code>The authenticity of host 'barcoo.vlsci.org.au (131.172.36.150)' can't be  established.\n...\nAre you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?\n</code></pre>  Although you should never ignore a warning, this particular one is nothing to be concerned about; type **yes** and then **press enter**.  If all goes well you will be asked to enter your password.  Assuming you type the correct username and password the system should  then display a welcome message, and then present you with a Unix prompt.  If you get this far then you are ready to start entering  Unix commands and thus begin using the remote computer.   Windows  On Microsoft Windows (Vista, 7, 8) we recommend that you use the PuTTY ssh client.  PuTTY (putty.exe) can be downloaded  from this web page:  [http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html)  Documentation for using PuTTY is here:  [http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/docs.html](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/docs.html)  When you start PuTTY you should see a window which looks something like this:    To connect to *barcoo* you should enter *barcoo.vlsci.org.au* into the box entitled \"Host Name (or IP address)\"  and *22* in the port,  then click on the Open button. All of the settings should remain the same as they were when PuTTY started (which should be the  same as they are in the picture above).  In some circumstances you will be presented with a window entitled PuTTY Security Alert. It will say something along the lines  of *\"The server's host key is not cached in the registry\"*. This is nothing to worry about, and you should agree to continue (by  clicking on Yes). You usually see this message the first time you try to connect to a particular remote computer.  If all goes well, a terminal window will open, showing a prompt with the text *\"login as:\"*. An example terminal window is shown  below. You should type your *barcoo* username and press enter. After entering your username you will be prompted for your  password. Assuming you type the correct username and password the system should then display a welcome message, and then  present you with a Unix prompt. If you get this far then you are ready to start entering Unix commands and thus begin using  the remote computer."},{"location":"tutorials/hpc/hpc/#topic-1-exploring-an-hpc","title":"Topic 1: Exploring an HPC","text":"<p>An HPC (short for \u2018High-Performance Computer\u2019) is simply a collection of Server Grade computers that work together to solve large problems.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure: Overview of the computers involved when using an HPC.

Termed \u2018hybrid assembly\u2019, we will use read data produced from two different sequencing platforms, Illumina (short read) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (long read), to reconstruct a bacterial genome sequence.</p> <p>In this tutorial we will perform \u2018de novo assembly\u2019. De novo assembly is the process of assembling a genome from scratch using only the sequenced reads as input - no reference genome is used.  This approach is common practise when working with microorganisms, and has seen increasing use for eukaryotes (including humans) in recent times.  </p> <p>Using short read data (Illumina) alone for de novo assembly will produce a complete genome, but in pieces (commonly called a \u2018draft genome\u2019). For the genome to be assembled into a single chromosome (plus a sequence for each plasmid), reads would need to be longer than the longest repeated element on the genome (usually ~7,000 base pairs, Note: Illumina reads are 350 base maximum).   Draft bacterial genome sequences are cheap to produce (less than AUD$60) and useful (&gt;300,000 draft Salmonella enterica genome sequences published at NCBI https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/organisms/), but sometimes you need a high-quality \u2018finished\u2019 bacterial genome sequence.  There are &lt;1,000 are \u2018finished\u2019 or \u2018closed\u2019 Salmonella enterica genome sequences.</p> <p>In these cases, long reads can be used together with short reads to produce a high-quality assembly.  Nanopore long reads (commonly &gt;40,000 bases) can fully span repeats, and reveal how all the genome fragments should be arranged. Long reads currently have higher error rate than short reads, so the combination of technologies is particularly powerful. Long reads provide information on the genome structure, and short reads provide high base-level accuracy.  </p> <p>Combining read data from the long and short read sequencing platforms allows the production of a complete genome sequence with very few sequence errors, but the cost of the read data is about AUD$ 1,000 to produce the sequence. Understandably, we usually produce a draft genome sequence with very few sequence errors using the Illumina sequencing platform.</p> <p>Nanopore sequencing technology is rapidly improving, expect the cost difference to reduce!!</p> <p>Data: Nanopore reads, Illlumina reads, bacterial organism (Bacillus subtilis) reference genome Tools: Flye, Pilon, Unicycler, Quast, BUSCO Pipeline: Hybrid de novo genome assembly - Nanopore draft Illumina polishing Pipeline: Hybrid de novo genome assembly - Unicycler</p> <p>Slides and workshop instructions  Click here for the slides.

Short read technology can only sequence a few hundred base-pairs in a single read. To provide better structural information, paired-end sequencing was created, where longer fragments (fixed length) are used. A few hundred bp is sequenced at both ends of the fragment, leaving the middle section unsequenced. The reads produced (the mate-pair) from a single fragment are separated by a fixed length, so we know they are nearby in the genome.  <p>Does Unicycler begin by using the Long or Short reads?</p> Answer (click to reveal) Unicycler uses short reads first. It creates an assembly graph from short reads, then uses the long reads to provide better structural information of the genome.  <p>How does Unicycler use long reads to improve its assembly graph?</p> Answer (click to reveal) The assembly graph produced by short reads has tangled regions.

Termed \u2018hybrid assembly\u2019, we will use read data produced from two different sequencing platforms, Illumina (short read) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (long read), to reconstruct a bacterial genome sequence.</p> <p>In this tutorial we will perform \u2018de novo assembly\u2019. De novo assembly is the process of assembling a genome from scratch using only the sequenced reads as input - no reference genome is used.  This approach is common practise when working with microorganisms, and has seen increasing use for eukaryotes (including humans) in recent times.  </p> <p>Using short read data (Illumina) alone for de novo assembly will produce a complete genome, but often in many pieces (commonly called a \u2018draft genome\u2019). For the genome to be assembled into a single chromosome (plus a sequence for each plasmid), reads would need to be longer than the longest repeated element on the genome (usually ~7,000 base pairs, Note: Illumina reads are 350 base maximum).   Draft bacterial genome sequences are cheap to produce (less than AUD$60) and useful (&gt;300,000 draft Salmonella enterica genome sequences published at NCBI https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/organisms/), but sometimes you need a high-quality \u2018finished\u2019 bacterial genome sequence.  There are &lt;1,000 are \u2018finished\u2019 or \u2018closed\u2019 Salmonella enterica genome sequences.</p> <p>In these cases, long reads can be used together with short reads to produce a high-quality assembly.  Nanopore long reads (commonly &gt;40,000 bases) can fully span repeats, and reveal how all the genome fragments should be arranged. Long reads currently have higher error rate than short reads, so the combination of technologies is particularly powerful. Long reads provide information on the genome structure, and short reads provide high base-level accuracy.  </p> <p>Combining read data from the long and short read sequencing platforms allows the production of a complete genome sequence with very few sequence errors, but the cost of the read data is about AUD$ 1,000 to produce the sequence.

We reduced the number of k-mer steps from 10 to 5 in SPAdes assembly (overall worse assembly), have disabled assembly polishing (improves base-level accuracy), and have chosen not to set the start of each replicon to a standard position.

Short read technology can only sequence a few hundred base-pairs in a single read. To provide better structural information, paired-end sequencing was created, where longer fragments (fixed length) are used. A few hundred bp is sequenced at both ends of the fragment, leaving the middle section unsequenced. The reads produced (the mate-pair) from a single fragment are separated by a fixed length, so we know they are nearby in the genome.   <p>Does Unicycler begin by using the Long or Short reads?</p> Answer (click to reveal) Unicycler uses short reads first. It creates an assembly graph from short reads, then uses the long reads to provide better structural information of the genome.   <p>How does Unicycler use long reads to improve its assembly graph?</p> Answer (click to reveal) The assembly graph produced by short reads has tangled regions. When we don't know how sections of the genome are arranged, tangled regions appear in the graph.  Unicycler uses Nanopore reads which overlap these tangled regions to resolve the proper structure of the genome.   <p></p> <p></p>"},{"location":"tutorials/hybrid_assembly/nanopore_assembly_1hr/#section-3-assessing-assembly-quality","title":"Section 3: Assessing assembly quality","text":"<p>Once we have created the assembly, we need to assess its quality.

Research groups currently invest a lot of time and effort in creating and updating workflows; the ability to translate from one workflow language into another can make them easier to share, and maintain with minimal effort. For example, research groups that would like to run an existing Galaxy workflow on HPC, or extend it for their use, might find translating the workflow to Nextflow more suitable for their ongoing use-cases. </p> <p>Janis is a framework that provides an abstraction layer for describing workflows, and a tool that can translate workflows between existing languages such as CWL, WDL, Galaxy and Nextflow. Janis aims to translate as much as it can, leaving the user to validate the workflow and make small manual adjustments where direct translations are not possible.

The <code>bam</code> input is an indexed bam type, so requires a <code>.bai</code> file to also be present in the working directory.  To facilitate this, we supply the <code>bam</code> input as a tuple of 2 files: <code>[filename.bam, filename.bam.bai]</code>.  <code>def bam = bam[0]</code> is used so when we reference <code>${bam}</code> in the script body, we are refering to the <code>.bam</code> file in that list.  (2) <code>def ploidy = ploidy != params.NULL_VALUE ? \"-ploidy ${ploidy}\" : \"\"</code>  This is how we handle optional val inputs in nextflow.  Nextflow doesn\u2019t like null values to be passed to process inputs, so we use 2 different tricks to make optional inputs possible. For <code>val</code> inputs we set up a <code>NULL_VALUE</code> param in <code>nextflow.config</code> which we use as a placeholder.   For <code>path</code> inputs (ie files and directories) we set up a null file rather than passing null directly.  This ensures that the file is staged correctly in the working directory when an actual filepath is provided.  The format above is a ternary operator of the form <code>def myvar = cond_check ? cond_true : cond_false</code>. We are redefining the <code>ploidy</code> string variable so that it will be correctly formatted when used in the script block. If we supply an actual value, it will take the form <code>\"-ploidy ${ploidy}\"</code>.  If we supply the placeholder <code>params.NULL_VALUE</code> value, it will be a blank string <code>\"\"</code>.  (3) <code>def intervals_joined = intervals.join(' ')</code>  Templates our <code>intervals</code> list of strings to a single string. Each item is joined by a space: eg <code>[\"hello\", \"there\"]</code> -&gt; <code>\"hello there\"</code>.  (4) <code>def dbsnp_vcf = dbsnp_vcf[0] != null ? \"--dbsnp ${dbsnp_vcf[0]}\" : \"\"</code> Same as (2) except uses a different check for null value, and selects the primary <code>.vcf.gz</code> file.  As the <code>path dbsnp_vcf</code> input is optional and consists of a <code>.vcf.gz</code> and <code>.vcf.gz.tbi</code> file, <code>dbsnp_vcf[0] != null</code> checks if the primary <code>.vcf.gz</code> file is present.  If true, it templates a string we can use in the script body to provide the required argument: <code>--dbsnp ${dbsnp_vcf[0]}</code>. If false, it templates an empty string. This ensures that when we use <code>${dbsnp_vcf}</code> in the script body, it will be formatted correctly for either case.</p> <p></p> <p>This translation is correct for the <code>gatk_haplotype_caller.cwl</code> file and needs no adjusting.

These are used to supply data according to nextflow\u2019s adoption of the dataflow programming model. <pre><code>// data which will be passed as channels\nch_bams        = Channel.fromPath( params.bams ).toList()\nch_readgroups  = Channel.of( params.readgroups ).toList()\n\n// data which will be passed as variables\nreference  = params.reference.collect{ file(it) }\n</code></pre></p> <p>Focusing on the channel declarations, we want to note a few things:</p> <ul> <li> <p><code>ch_bams</code> is analygous to the \u2018bams\u2019 input in <code>align_sort_markdup.cwl</code>.  It declares a queue channel which expects the data supplied via <code>params.bams</code> are <code>path</code> types.  It then groups the bams together as a sole emission using <code>.toList()</code>.  We will need to set up <code>params.bams</code> to supply this data.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>ch_readgroups</code> is analygous to the \u2018readgroups\u2019 input in <code>align_sort_markdup.cwl</code>.  It is the same as <code>ch_bams</code>, except it requires <code>val</code> types rather than <code>path</code> types.  We will need to set up <code>params.readgroups</code> to supply this data.</p> </li> </ul> <p>We also see a new variable called <code>reference</code> being created. </p> <p>This <code>reference</code> var is analygous to the \u2018reference\u2019 input in <code>align_sort_markdup.cwl</code>.  It collects the \u2018reference\u2019 primary &amp; secondary files together in a list. </p> <p>We will need to set up <code>params.reference</code> to supply this data. </p> <p></p> <p>Note: Why does <code>reference</code> appear as a variable, rather than a <code>Channel</code>?  In Nextflow, we find it is best to create Channels for data that moves through the pipeline.  The <code>ch_bams</code> channel is created because we want to consume / transform the input bams during the pipeline.   On the other hand, the <code>reference</code> genome variable is not something we really want to consume or transform.   It\u2019s more like static helper data which can be used by processes, but it doesn\u2019t move through our pipeline, and definitely shouldn\u2019t be consumed or transformed in any way. </p> <p></p> <p>Note: <code>.toList()</code>  Nextflow queue channels work differently to lists.  Instead of supplying all items together, queue channels emit each item separately.   This results in a separate task being spawned for each item in the queue when the channel is used.  As the CWL workflow input specifies that <code>bams</code> is a list, we use <code>.toList()</code> to group all items as a sole emission.  This mimics a CWL array which is the datatype of the <code>bams</code> inputs.  As it turns out, the CWL workflow ends up running the <code>align</code> step in parallel across the <code>bams</code> &amp; <code>readgroups</code> inputs.  Parallelisation in nextflow happens by default.  To facilitate this, the <code>.flatten()</code> method is called on  <code>ch_bams</code> and <code>ch_readgroups</code> when used in the <code>ALIGN</code> task.  This emits items in <code>ch_bams</code> and <code>ch_readgroups</code> individually, spawning a new <code>ALIGN</code> task for each pair.  We\u2019re kinda doing redundant work by calling <code>.toList()</code>, then <code>.flatten()</code> when <code>ch_bams</code> and <code>ch_readgroups</code> are used. <code>janis translate</code> isn\u2019t smart enough yet to detect this yet, but may do so in future. </p> <p></p> <p>Continuing down <code>main.nf</code>, we see the main <code>workflow {}</code> has 5 tasks. </p> <p>Each task has been supplied values according to the source workflow. Comments display the name of the process/workflow input which is being fed a particular value. </p> <pre><code>workflow {\n\n    ALIGN(\n        ch_bams.flatten(),       // bam\n        ch_reference,            // reference\n        ch_readgroups.flatten()  // readgroup\n    )\n\n    INDEX_BAM(\n        MARK_DUPLICATES_AND_SORT.out.sorted_bam.map{ tuple -&gt; tuple[0] }  // bam\n    )\n\n    MARK_DUPLICATES_AND_SORT(\n        params.mark_duplicates_and_sort.script,  // script\n        NAME_SORT.out.name_sorted_bam,           // bam\n        params.NULL_VALUE,                       // input_sort_order\n        params.final_name                        // output_name\n    )\n\n    MERGE(\n        ALIGN.out.tagged_bam.toList(),  // bams\n        params.final_name               // name\n    )\n\n    NAME_SORT(\n        MERGE.out.merged_bam  // bam\n    )\n\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Before <code>main.nf</code> can be run, we will need to supply values for the <code>params</code> variables.  This is done in <code>nextflow.config</code>. </p> <p></p> <p>Inspect nextflow.config</p> <p>To test the translated workflow, we will first set up workflow inputs in <code>nextflow.config</code>. </p> <p>Before running a workflow, nextflow will attempt to open <code>nextflow.config</code> and read in config information and global param variables from this file.

We will then make changes to the HISAT2 process script &amp; outputs.</p> <p></p> <p>Note: Why does this happen? Galaxy often uses temporary variables to configure / sanitise values. It\u2019s common for Galaxy tools to reassign an input to a temporary value, then pass that temp value to the actual software command.

Mappability is the ability to unambiguously align reads to a reference.

This repetitive sequence consists of 2 main elements: mobile elements, and repeats. Mobile elements are sections of DNA which copy or move themselves throughout our genome and include retrotransposons (LINE, SINE, LTR, and SVA) and DNA transposons. Repeats are genomic regions which contain the same sequence repeated many times, and consist of Short Tandem Repeats (STRs / microsatellites) which are 1-6 bp tandem repeats, or Variable Number of Tandem Repeats (VNTRs / minisatellites) which are tandem repeats where the repeat length is greater than 7 bp.  </p>"},{"location":"tutorials/longread_sv_calling/longread_sv_calling/#applications-of-structural-variant-detection","title":"Applications of Structural Variant Detection","text":"<p>The importance of structural variation has become more apparent in recent years.

As shown in the image below, once library construction and sequencing are done as per the design of the experiment, the resulting sequencing data (FASTQ files) will go through two steps of quality control (QC). The first QC is for checking the sequencing quality. Popular FASTQ quality assessment tools, such as FastQC, should be able to report the overall quality of the sequencing data. FastQC also reports the over-represented sequences in the FASTQ file. This is particularly important for miRNA-seq. In miRNA-seq data the 3\u2019-adapter sequence almost always appears in every read, because the typical read-length of sequencing machines exceed the full length of mature miRNAs. Unless there is a serious contamination, the most over-represented sequence in the FASTQ file should be the 3\u2019adapter sequence. Unlike 3\u2019-adapter sequence, 5\u2019-adapter sequence should be appear in the FASTQ file. If it does, it would mean poor library quality or poor sequencing quality. Once the over-represented sequences are identified as 3\u2019-adapter sequence, sequence trimming tools, such as Trimmomatic, can trim out from each read the adapter sequence and/or prevailing or trailing poor quality regions. The second QC checks more specifically for the library quality. At this stage, 3\u2019-adapter sequence should be removed from the sequencing data. Without 3\u2019-adapter sequence, each read should contains only the mature miRNA sequence, the length of which typically ranges 20-25nt. If the trimmed sequences include a large quantity of sequence reads that are outside of this size-range, it may mean high level of contamination at the library construction stage. After two-steps of QC, when all look good, the trimmed reads will be mapped to the genome. From this alignment result, the expression level known miRNAs can be  measured, and novel miRNAs can be also identified and quantified. Known/unknown miRNAs were identified and quantified across samples from multiple groups (e.g., disease vs control), differential expression analysis can follow using other popular tools, such as edgeR. </p>"},{"location":"tutorials/miRNAseq_basic/intro_miRNAseq/#section-3-example-dataset-from-ncbi-geo","title":"Section 3: Example dataset from NCBI GEO","text":"<p>In this section, we will import the example dataset to Galaxy for the analysis.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/miRNAseq_basic/intro_miRNAseq/#example-dataset-from-ncbi-geo","title":"Example dataset from NCBI GEO","text":"<p>GSE: GSE56862 SRA: SRP041228  This GEO dataset GSE56832 consist of 12 samples, including 7 small RNA-seq samples and 5 RNA-seq samples.

We will use more sophisticated scripts to launch and manage our jobs that will direct output to appropriate directories.</p> <p>This directory is found on Snowy, under /vlsci/examples/namd/Namd_intermediate_template.</p> <p>It has a particular directory structure as follows:</p> <pre><code>/Namd_intermediate_template\n\n    sbatch_start            \u2190 script to start equilibration phase\n    sbatch_production       \u2190 script to start production phase\n\n    sim_opt.conf            \u2190 Namd configuration file for optimization\n    sim_production.conf     \u2190 Namd configuration file for production run\n\n    project_plan.txt        \u2190 A guide to thinking about your simulation\n    counter.txt             \u2190 File for keeping track of job number\n    max_jobnumber.txt       \u2190 Defines maximum number of jobs\n\n    /BUILD_DIR              \u2190 this is where we will build our models\n\n    /Errors                 \u2190 errors go here\n\n    /Examples               \u2190 find some example files here\n\n    /InputFiles             \u2190 our input files go here\n        /Parameters\n\n    /JobLog                 \u2190 details of our running jobs end up here\n\n    /LastRestart            \u2190 If we need to restart a job\n\n    /OutputFiles            \u2190 Our NAMD output goes here\n\n    /OutputText             \u2190 Text output from the job\n\n    /RestartFiles           \u2190 Generic restart files saved here\n</code></pre> <p>Rather than running one long job, this template is designed to run into smaller stages. After we build a model and make the appropriate changes to the input files the run is started by launching:</p> <p><code>sbatch sbatch_start</code> (don\u2019t do this just yet!)</p> <p>This will launch a job using the sim_opt.conf configuration file which is designed to equilibrate the system. At the conclusion of the equilibration run, the script will automatically launch the production run: sbatch sbatch_production</p> <p>Production runs are designed to run less than 24 hours at a time, at the end of which restart files are saved and relaunch themselves for another 24 hour job. Every time they do, the script increases a counter.txt file by 1. Once that reaches the number in the MaxJobNumber.txt file, the job stops. For example, if a 24 hour job completes 5 nanoseconds of simulation a day, and we want a contiguous simulation of say 50 ns, then we\u2019d set the counter.txt file to 0 and the MaxJobNumber.txt to 10 and thus would expect the job to finish in 10 days. The advantage of running a series of smaller jobs rather than one long one is better scheduling on the cluster, and also better protection from data corruption should there be a hardware failure.</p> <p>The script also date stamps and directs the output to the appropriate folders. A complete dcd trajectory can be reconstructed from the ordered files in the /OutputFile directory.</p> <p>More of running a job later.

We now need to make changes to the NAMD configuration files to match our new inputs.

Since we have a simple protein model the default parameter file should be fine:</p> <pre><code>paraTypeCharmm  on\nparameters      InputFiles/Parameters/par_all27_prot_na.prm\n</code></pre> <p>If we were running lipids in the simulation or used a separately parameterized ligand we would add a few extra lines here, say for example:</p> <pre><code>parameters  InputFiles/Parameters/par_all27_prot_lipid.prm\nparameters  InputFiles/Parameters/par_for_ligand.prm\n</code></pre> <p>We also need to make changes to match our periodic boundary conditions (PBC).</p> <p>The way PBC works is that our simulation box has a certain rectangular geometry which is mirrored on all sides to mimic an infinite system. A molecule which falls out of the left and side of the box fall back in on the right hand side. A molecule that falls out of the bottom reappears at the top and so on. Care has to be given when building a solvated PBC system so that a protein molecule has enough room around its edges so that it doesn\u2019t interact with itself should it wander too close to a boundary.</p> <p>Since our box ended up being of dimensions 80 x 64 x 64 \u00c5, this is reflected in the PBC parameters here:</p> <pre><code>cellBasisVector1   80.  0.  0.\ncellBasisVector2    0. 64.  0.\ncellBasisVector3    0.  0. 64.\ncellOrigin          0   0   0\n</code></pre> <p>That should do it for the optimization configuration file. The idea of the optimization phase is to equilibrate your simulation and allow it to settle before running production runs. Typically we run this with a NPT ensemble, (whereby the number of particles (N) pressure (P) and temperature (T) remain constant). The volume is allowed to change as water and lipids can find their optimal density. At the end of the optimization phase, the sbatch_start script takes the generic output of the run and renames it to pass on to the production phase of the simulation. The sbatch_script will automatically launch the production phase on successful completion of the optimization phase.</p> <p>The sim_production.conf file controls how we run a segment of the production phase including the type of simulation and how long it runs. The file MaxJobNumber.txt determines how many times this production script is run. Each time a production segment finishes, output is date-stamped and placed in appropriate folders, while restart files are written, ready to launch the next segment. The number in the file counter.txt is increased by 1 to keep track of the jobs. Typically we aim to keep these segments running less than 24 hours at a time. This has a number of advantages, firstly, if the machine should have a failure the most you will loose is one days simulation which is easy to recover from the last restart file. Secondly, this strategy helps with efficiently filling the machine with jobs and keeping your groups quota available. Long jobs scheduled for weeks can tie up resources, quota and risk losing all the generated data should there be a failure in that time.</p> <p>Open the sim_production.conf file:</p> <p>Since we would like to run a relatively short job segment for this exercise, we will change the line:</p> <pre><code>set NumberSteps 2500\n</code></pre> <p>to:</p> <pre><code>set NumberSteps 20000\n</code></pre> <p>This segment will run for only 20,000 x 2 fs = 0.04 ns at a time. For example, if we set max_jobnumber.txt to be 5 then we will should get 0.2 ns worth of simulation.</p> <p>Edit the counter.txt file to contain the number 0. (The counter file is a way of running a certain number of jobs. This increments up after each job finished until it reaches the same as MaxJobNumber.txt and then stops). In linux we can simply use:</p> <pre><code>echo 0 &gt; counter.txt\n</code></pre> <p>Then edit the MaxJobNumber.txt file to contain the number 5. This will limit the total number of jobs run. Jobs will stop when counter.txt value is equal to or greater than the MaxJobNumber.txt value.</p> <pre><code>echo 5 &gt; MaxJobNumber.txt\n</code></pre> <p>We can always make this number bigger later and restart the jobs if we want things to go longer.</p> <p>For this short example we will also change more lines in the sim_production.conf file:</p> <pre><code>restartfreq     2500\ndcdfreq         5000\nxstFreq         5000\noutputEnergies  5000\noutputPressure  5000\noutputTiming    5000\n</code></pre> <p>to:</p> <pre><code>restartfreq     25000\ndcdfreq         5000\nxstFreq         5000\noutputEnergies  5000\noutputPressure  5000\noutputTiming    5000\n</code></pre> <p>We don\u2019t have to change the periodic boundary conditions in the sim_production.conf file as we read in the restart files from the previous simulation namely:</p> <pre><code>set inputname generic_restartfile\nbinCoordinates $inputname.coor  ; # Coordinates from last run (binary)\nbinVelocities  $inputname.vel   ; # Velocities from last run (binary)\nextendedSystem $inputname.xsc   ; # Cell dimensions from last run\n</code></pre> <p>There are a number of other control parameters in the production configuration script worth taking a look at including such things as cutoffs and temperature controls if you have time. These don\u2019t change much typically between simulations, but are covered better in the online NAMD tutorials and manuals.

Both are methodologies that, in addition to the sequence information, give you information about the physical distance between the two reads in your genome. For example, you shear up some genomic DNA, and cut a region out at ~500bp. Then you prepare your library, and sequence 35bp from each end of each molecule. Now you have three pieces of information:</p> <ul> <li>the tag 1 sequence</li> <li>the tag 2 sequence*</li> <li>that they were 500bp \u00b1 (some) apart in your genome</li> </ul> <p>When we do 2x 50 bp paired-end runs on a GAIIx using the current gel purification step we get read distances of between that vary by about 100 bp in a nice tight bell shaped curve starting between 160-200 bp. So the first thing to bear in mind is that L is not fixed within or between runs. Either way this group accounts for &gt;99.99% of paired-end reads in an assembly. Because of the way fragments are generated for sequencing 1 and 2 can align either F-B of B-F.</p> <p>If you want to be more realistic there are always a tiny proportion of reads &lt;0.1% that align with much longer read distances, some of which is due to bioinformatics but some of which is real and simply reflects biology. Likewise a tiny proportion of reads at all read distances will be F-F or B-B. Also there appear to often be a tiny proportion of reads that come out overlapping where the read distance is the same as a read length ie 1+L+2 is, in this case, ~50-100. I have no idea of the prevelance of such reads but you can often find them if you look. Lastly if its not going to be part of the assembler, end trimming and quality trimming can often mean that 1 and 2 are different lengths and that a substantial number of reads from a paired end run end up with no partner at all.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/ngs_overview/NGS_Overview/#mate-pair-sequencing","title":"Mate-pair sequencing","text":"<p>Illumina refers to \u201cpaired end\u201d as the original library preparation method they use, where you sequence each end of the same molecule.

This method still actually only sequences the ends of ~400bp molecules, but this template is derived from both ends of a 2-10kb fragment that has had the middle section cut out and the \u2018internal\u2019 ends ligated in the middle. Basically, you take your 2-10kb random fragments, biotinylate the end, circularise them, shear the circles to ~400bp, capture biotinylated molecules, and then sequence those (they go into what is essentially a standard \u2018paired end\u2019 sample prep procedure).</p> <p>Source: http://seqanswers.com/forums/showthread.php?t=503</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/pacbio/","title":"de novo assembly of PacBio reads (unix)","text":""},{"location":"tutorials/pacbio/#long-read-assembly-workshop","title":"Long read assembly workshop","text":"<p>This is a tutorial for a workshop on long-read (PacBio) genome assembly.</p> <p>It demonstrates how to use long PacBio sequencing reads to assemble a bacterial genome, and includes additional steps for circularising, trimming, finding plasmids, and correcting the assembly with short-read Illumina data.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/pacbio/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>Simplified version of workflow:</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"tutorials/pacbio/#1-get-started","title":"1.

You can read more about mass spectrometry data formats by clicking the <code>Data Formats and pre-processing</code> bar below.</p> Data Formats and pre-processing <p>Mass Spectrometry data analysis is plagued by an overabundance of file formats.  The good news is that the Mass Spec community, including many instrument vendors have developed a standard file format for raw data, mzML.  The bad news is that many of the old formats are still in widespread use, and most instruments don\u2019t produce it natively.  The reference implementation of the mzML standard is a software suite called ProteoWizard. ProteoWizard includes a very handy tool called <code>msconvert</code> that is capable of converting raw data from most instruments into <code>mzML</code> or into one of many other formats.  In addition to format conversion, <code>msconvert</code> can also perform a wide variety of noise filtering and peak-picking functions to prepare data for analysis.  A typical pre-processing involves;</p> <ol> <li>Conversion from instrument .raw to mzML</li> <li>Peak picking on both MS1 and MS2 data using vendor-native peak picking routines (built in to msconvert)</li> <li>Denoising of MS2 data either by thresholding or by keeping only the largest peaks withing a moving window</li> <li>Convert spectrum identifiers into a standardized format</li> </ol> <p>To convert files from raw instrument native formats to <code>mzML</code> a windows PC is required.  If you need to do this, be sure to download ProteoWizard with vendor reader support.  This package comes with <code>MSConvertGUI</code> which allows conversion of raw files using a graphical interface.  Once files are in <code>mzML</code> or <code>mgf</code> format they can be converted to various other formats using the <code>msconvert3</code> tool in Galaxy.</p> <p></p> <p>1) What format is the OrganelleSample.mzML file?</p> Hint <p>Try clicking the title bar on the data in your galaxy history.  This will toggle display of some additional information about the data.</p> Answer <p>mzML</p> <p>MS versus MS/MS:</p> <p>A key feature of Tandem mass spectrometry is the acquisition of mass spectra (spectra) that measure the masses of precursor ions (whole peptides) as well as spectra that measure the fragment masses of a single selected peptide.  These two types of measurements are called MS and MS/MS spectra respectively.  The following schematic shows how an MS/MS scan results from the fragmentation of a selected product ion.  Often multiple MS/MS spectra are obtained for each MS scan, selecting different precursor masses each time so that as many peptides as possible can be analyzed.</p> <p></p> <p>Number of spectra:</p> <p>Click the eye icon on the history item to view the mzML file as text.  The file is almost impossible to read by hand but with some text searching we will be able to deduce the number of MS and MS/MS spectra in the file.</p> <p>Now try searching for the text \u201cMS1 spectrum\u201d in the page using your web browser\u2019s search function.  Looking closely you should see that this text appears once for every MS1 spectrum in the file (plus it occurs one extra time at the top of the file as part of the file description).  The file is large though and the browser can only see the first megabyte of it.</p> <p>Now search for the text \u201cspectrumList count\u201d. It should bring you to a line in the file that says spectrumList count=\u201d24941\u201d.  There are a total of 24941 spectra in the entire file including both MS and MS/MS spectra.</p> <p>2) How many MS spectra are there in this dataset?</p> Hint <p>To answer this question you will need to use the Select tool from the Filter and Sort submenu to select lines matching the text \u201cMS1 spectrum\u201d in the whole file.

If peaks can be unambiguously identified for all these pairs then the sequence of a peptide can simply be read off from the fragmentation spectrum itself.  Unfortunately this is almost never the case using current instrumentation, and the only practical method to determine the sequences of peptides and proteins present in a sample is to compare spectra with a database of potential proteins.  This <code>database</code> is usually just a <code>FASTA</code> formatted file containing amino acid sequences for all known proteins from your study organism.  Constructing this database is a crucial first step in any proteomics analysis because only peptide sequences present in the database will appear in the results.  In order to detect a peptide, its exact sequence must be explicitly included in the database.</p> <p>Large vs Small Database</p> <p>Since it is impossible to detect a peptide unless it is present in the search database, one might consider using a very large database such as the full content of <code>NCBInr</code>.  There are two problems with this.  The most important is that the sensivity of a search goes down as the search space goes up, which means that searches on large databases often return far fewer hits.  Another, more practical issue is that searching a large database often takes an extremely long time, and might even crash your search engine.</p> <p>Note that very small databases can also cause problems.  In particular, some search engines, and most search engine post-processing statistical tools attempt to model the shape of peptide-sequence-match (PSM) score distributions.  With a very small database (or with very few spectra) it may not be possible to model these distributions accurately.  In most practical situations this is not an issue.</p> <p>Typical sources of data for search databases</p> <ul> <li> <p>Uniprot.org: This is the canonical resource for publicly available protein sequences. It includes two large databases <code>SwissProt</code>, which contains manually curated sequences and <code>Trembl</code> which contains sequences automatically generated from genomic and transcriptomic data.</p> </li> <li> <p>An Organism Specific database: In some cases, a community of researchers working on specific organisms will create their own sequence data repositories.  Some of these are well maintained and are the best source of data for that study organism.

A better estimate can be obtained by running a tool that uses global statistical properties of the search to assign a probability to each PSM of being correct.  A number of tools exist for this, and in this tutorial we use Peptide Prophet, which can work with a wide variety of different search engine scoring systems. It is extremely useful as it effectively converts disparate scores to the common scale of probability. The probabilities produced by Peptide Prophet can be used to set a threshold for acceptance.  For example we could decide to accept only PSM\u2019s with a probability greater than 0.95. Note that this is not the same as the False Discovery Rate which is computed by taking (1-p) for all the accepted PSM\u2019s and dividing by the total number of accepted PSM\u2019s.

The overall group probability is high (<code>1.0</code>) but probabilities group members are different.  The first member of the group has a high probability <code>0.99</code> but all other members have probabilities of <code>0.0</code>.  This is because all of the high scoring peptides are contained in the first entry.  Evidence for the other entries consists of either (a) peptides that are contained in the first entry or (b) peptides with very low scores. Protein Prophet uses the principle of Occam\u2019s razor;</p> <p>plurality should not be posited with out necessity</p> <p>In other words, unless otherwise indicated by a unique peptide, we should assume that shared peptides come from the same protein.</p> <p>Anomalous groups</p> <p>In rare cases Protein Prophet fails produces strange results when its algorithm fails to converge.

We\u2019ll first apply the core-metrics-phylogenetic method, which rarefies a FeatureTable[Frequency] to a user-specified depth, computes several alpha- and beta- diversity metrics, and generates principle coordinates analysis (PCoA) plots using Emperor for each of the beta diversity metrics.</p> <p>The metrics computed by default are:</p> <ul> <li>Alpha diversity (operate on a single sample (i.e. within sample diversity)).<ul> <li>Shannon\u2019s diversity index (a quantitative measure of community richness)</li> <li>Observed OTUs (a qualitative measure of community richness)</li> <li>Faith\u2019s Phylogenetic Diversity (a qualitative measure of community richness that incorporates phylogenetic relationships between the features)</li> <li>Evenness (or Pielou\u2019s Evenness; a measure of community evenness)</li> </ul> </li> <li>Beta diversity (operate on a pair of samples (i.e. between sample diversity)).<ul> <li>Jaccard distance (a qualitative measure of community dissimilarity)</li> <li>Bray-Curtis distance (a quantitative measure of community dissimilarity)</li> <li>unweighted UniFrac distance (a qualitative measure of community dissimilarity that incorporates phylogenetic relationships between the features)</li> <li>weighted UniFrac distance (a quantitative measure of community dissimilarity that incorporates phylogenetic relationships between the features)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>An important parameter that needs to be provided to this script is <code>--p-sampling-depth</code>, which is the even sampling (i.e. rarefaction) depth that was determined above. As most diversity metrics are sensitive to different sampling depths across different samples, this script will randomly subsample the counts from each sample to the value provided for this parameter. For example, if <code>--p-sampling-depth 500</code> is provided, this step will subsample the counts in each sample without replacement, so that each sample in the resulting table has a total count of 500. If the total count for any sample(s) are smaller than this value, those samples will be excluded from the diversity analysis. Choosing this value is tricky. We recommend making your choice by reviewing the information presented in the 16s_table_filtered.qzv file that was created above. Choose a value that is as high as possible (so more sequences per sample are retained), while excluding as few samples as possible.</p> <pre><code>qiime diversity core-metrics-phylogenetic \\\n  --i-phylogeny analysis/tree/16s_rooted_tree.qza \\\n  --i-table analysis/taxonomy/16s_table_filtered.qza \\\n  --p-sampling-depth 5583 \\\n  --m-metadata-file metadata.tsv \\\n  --output-dir analysis/diversity_metrics\n</code></pre> <p>Copy the <code>.qzv</code> files created from the above command into the <code>visualisations</code> subdirectory.</p> <pre><code>cp analysis/diversity_metrics/*.qzv analysis/visualisations\n</code></pre> <p>To view the differences between sample composition using unweighted UniFrac in ordination space, copy <code>analysis/visualisations/unweighted_unifrac_emperor.qzv</code> to your local computer and view in QIIME 2 View (q2view).</p> Visualisations: Unweighted UniFrac Emperor Ordination <p>Click to view the <code>unweighted_unifrac_emperor.qzv</code> file in QIIME 2 View.  </p> <p>On q2view, select the \u201cColor\u201d tab, choose \u201cEnvironment\u201d under the \u201cSelect a Color Category\u201d dropdown menu, then select the \u201cShape\u201d tab and choose \u201cGenotype\u201d under the \u201cSelect a Shape Category\u201d dropdown menu.  </p> <p></p> <p>Next, we\u2019ll test for associations between categorical metadata columns and alpha diversity data.

The following commands will test whether distances between samples within a group, such as samples from the same genotype, are more similar to each other then they are to samples from the other groups. If you call this command with the <code>--p-pairwise</code> parameter, as we\u2019ll do here, it will also perform pairwise tests that will allow you to determine which specific pairs of groups (e.g., AIMS1 and AIMS4) differ from one another, if any. This command can be slow to run, especially when passing <code>--p-pairwise</code>, since it is based on permutation tests. So, unlike the previous commands, we\u2019ll run beta-group-significance on specific columns of metadata that we\u2019re interested in exploring, rather than all metadata columns to which it is applicable.

QIIME 2\u2019s diversity analyses are available through the <code>q2-diversity</code> plugin, which supports computing alpha- and beta- diversity metrics, applying related statistical tests, and generating interactive visualisations. We\u2019ll first apply the core-metrics-phylogenetic method, which rarefies a FeatureTable[Frequency] to a user-specified depth, computes several alpha- and beta- diversity metrics, and generates principle coordinates analysis (PCoA) plots using Emperor for each of the beta diversity metrics.</p> <p>The metrics computed by default are:</p> <ul> <li>Alpha diversity (operate on a single sample (i.e. within sample diversity)).<ul> <li>Shannon\u2019s diversity index (a quantitative measure of community richness)</li> <li>Observed OTUs (a qualitative measure of community richness)</li> <li>Faith\u2019s Phylogenetic Diversity (a qualitative measure of community richness that incorporates phylogenetic relationships between the features)</li> <li>Evenness (or Pielou\u2019s Evenness; a measure of community evenness)</li> </ul> </li> <li>Beta diversity (operate on a pair of samples (i.e. between sample diversity)).<ul> <li>Jaccard distance (a qualitative measure of community dissimilarity)</li> <li>Bray-Curtis distance (a quantitative measure of community dissimilarity)</li> <li>unweighted UniFrac distance (a qualitative measure of community dissimilarity that incorporates phylogenetic relationships between the features)</li> <li>weighted UniFrac distance (a quantitative measure of community dissimilarity that incorporates phylogenetic relationships between the features)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>An important parameter that needs to be provided to this script is <code>--p-sampling-depth</code>, which is the even sampling (i.e. rarefaction) depth that was determined above. As most diversity metrics are sensitive to different sampling depths across different samples, this script will randomly subsample the counts from each sample to the value provided for this parameter. For example, if <code>--p-sampling-depth 500</code> is provided, this step will subsample the counts in each sample without replacement, so that each sample in the resulting table has a total count of 500. If the total count for any sample(s) are smaller than this value, those samples will be excluded from the diversity analysis. Choosing this value is tricky.

While there are many ways of measuring gene expression, the focus of this workshop will be (bulk) RNA-seq, a technology which (nominally) measures gene expression across the whole transcriptome, i.e. all RNA transcripts, in a sample.</p> <p>The main aim of this workshop is to show you how to go from a \u201ccounts table\u201d of RNA-seq data to a ranked list of differentially expressed (DE) genes using R and statistical software packages from Bioconductor (note: basic knowledge of R will be assumed). This aim may seem modest, but our approach will be to carefully discuss each step along the way. The motivation for this is twofold: (1) to give you some understanding and thus confidence in what you\u2019re doing; and (2) to give you some skills to judge whether the DE results you obtain are likely to be trustworthy or rubbish.</p> <p>The second motivation is important. In our context, rubbish DE results take two forms: missed discoveries (i.e. failing to infer a gene to be DE when it really is DE) or false discoveries (i.e. inferring a gene to be DE when it\u2019s actually not DE). Rubbish results are a real danger in the following way: you can competently do all the steps in this workshop and still arrive at rubbish! How is this possible? Because some data sets aren\u2019t amenable to the kinds of analyses we\u2019ll be discussing, and it\u2019s important to know when this occurs (if you care about the results!). Such data sets are typically problematic or difficult in some way and will require techniques and strategies beyond those contained in this workshop to obtain non-rubbish results. The good news, however, is that many data sets are amenable to the analyses we\u2019ll discuss.</p> <p>Important note. Our starting point for RNA-seq analysis will be a `table of counts\u2019; we won\u2019t begin from raw sequencing data (in the form of .fastq files). There\u2019s several reasons for this. Firstly, going from raw sequencing data to a table of counts can be computationally intensive and a little involved. Secondly, because of this, workshops often fail to spend enough time on the (more important) statistical part that comes after this, i.e. analysing the table of counts. Thirdly, many people have no interest in processing raw sequencing data; they\u2019re simply interested in analysing one of vast number of publicly available counts tables of RNA-seq data. If you\u2019ve generated raw sequencing data of your own (or want to look at publicly available raw sequencing files) then you should look at other workshops for how to go from this data to a table of counts. But, if you\u2019ve got a table of counts that you want to analyse, then this is the workshop for you!</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/rna-seq-lcg/#some-background","title":"Some background","text":"<p>RNA-seq involves several steps, as summarised in this figure:</p> <p></p> <p>We could say a lot more about each step, but this isn\u2019t our focus. For us, the important thing to know is that after this whole process we arrive at a table of counts\u2014the fundamental object of RNA-seq data analysis. For example, here\u2019s a made up table of counts for two groups (A and B) each with three biological replicates (using the typical \u2018genes rows, samples in columns\u2019 convention):</p> <p></p> <p>The counts quantify expression: more counts, more expression (roughly speaking\u2014see below). The fundamental question we want to ask is: which genes are DE between the groups? (e.g. is Gene 3 DE?)</p> <p>Before proceeding, some important comments about replicates:</p> <ol> <li>If you don\u2019t have replicates (ideally for all groups), STOP! You\u2019ll likely produce rubbish results (actually statistical tools will often give you an error in this situation, but not always!). Here \u201creplicates\u201d means biological replicates (data collected from distinct individuals), not technical replicates (data repeatedly collected from the same individual), a distinction nicely depicted in the figure below. Biological replicates are essential because you cannot do rigorous RNA-seq analysis (i.e. statistics) without them. Why? There are many reasons, e.g. you\u2019ll have no way of estimating the (biological) variation, i.e. \u201cnoise\u201d, in your data and so no way of properly comparing any \u201csignal\u201d (of DE) to the \u201cnoise\u201d (actually there are some ways around this issue but they\u2019re not recommended). Thus, 2 replicates is a minimum and 3+ replicates (depending on the context and situation) are recommended.</li> </ol> <p></p> <ol> <li>If you have technical replicates, PROCEED CAREFULLY! They shouldn\u2019t be analysed as if they were separate (independent) samples. Why? To see the main reason, consider an example: suppose one of your groups consists of three individuals each with 2 technical replications, making 3x2 = 6 samples in that group. It may seem like there\u2019s 6 samples in that group for doing the relevant statistics, but don\u2019t be fooled: there\u2019s only 3 independent samples (i.e. distinct individuals). If you analysed the 6 samples as if they were separate samples, your analysis would \u201coverestimate\u201d the amount of information available\u2014there\u2019s only 3 \u201cpieces\u201d of information, not 6\u2014and thus might produce many false discoveries (because the estimated variation might be too small). The standard advice for handling technical replicates is this: add the counts (gene-wise) of each technical replicate to produce single biological replicates. Note, however, that this only applies if there\u2019s no significant technical differences between the replicates (e.g. the technical replicates sit almost on top of each other in a PCA plot\u2014see below). If there are significant technical differences between the replicates (e.g. if each replicate is in different batch, which incidentally is one of the main reasons for generating technical replicates) then you should consult an expert. And, if you\u2019re in doubt about applying this advice, consult an expert!</li> </ol> <p>Another nice way of understanding the technical replicate issue above is through humour, e.g. reflect on the mistake being made in this xkcd comic:</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"tutorials/rna-seq-lcg/#example-data","title":"Example data","text":"<p>For illustration, we\u2019ll look at data from the publication: Obers et al. \u201cRetinoic acid and TGF-\u03b2 orchestrate organ-specific programs of tissue residency\u201d, Immunity (2024).

More precisely, removing genes with little to no expression, because the former add \u201cnoise\u201d while the latter aren\u2019t even relevant. There are various approaches to filtering, but one of the simplest is to use the <code>limma</code> function <code>filterByExpression</code>: <pre><code>keep &lt;- filterByExpr(dge, group=group) # logical vector indicating which rows of dge to keep\ntable(keep) # 32069 genes will be removed; 14009 genes will be kept\n\ndge &lt;- dge[keep,,keep.lib.size=FALSE]\nhead(dge$counts) # compare to pre-filtered data to see the difference\n</code></pre> Roughly speaking, this strategy keeps genes that have a reasonable number of counts in a worthwhile number samples, and removes them otherwise (see function help for precise details).</p> <p>Following filtering, you should check the library size of each sample. The library size of a sample is simply the sum of the counts in that library, i.e.</p> \\[ \\begin{align*} \\text{Library size for sample}\\ j &amp;= \\sum_{i} Y_{ij} \\\\ &amp; = \\sum_{\\substack{\\text{all genes}}} \\text{counts for sample}\\ j \\end{align*} \\] <p>where \\(Y_{ij}\\) is the count for gene \\(i\\) in sample \\(j\\).

One reason to check it is because bigger is usually better: 5 million or less (not that good); 10-15 million (better); 20+ million (much better). This is because (1) it\u2019s a limited resource that needs to be \u201cshared\u201d between all the genes (in proportion to their expression); and (2) bigger counts generally means better statistical properties (e.g. power to detect DE). Another reason to check is because it will help signpost what tools you should use to analyse your data (more about this later).</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/rna-seq-lcg/#visualisation","title":"Visualisation","text":"<p>The next thing to do is visualise your data. This allows you to (1) see the landscape of biological differences between experimental groups, and (2) assess whether the data is affected by technical variation. Detecting technical variation is particularly important because its presence leads to missed and/or false discoveries, i.e. rubbish DE results. Thus, this step is crucial: analysing RNA-seq data without visualisation is literally \u201cflying blind\u201d!</p> <p>There are many visualisation methods. Each has different advantages and show different aspects of the data\u2014there is no single perfect visualisation, so use several! Here we\u2019ll discuss three: </p> <ol> <li> <p>PCA plots. These give a special low dimensional representation of our (very) high dimensional data (i.e. where we\u2019ve taken thousands of measurements on each sample). A ``good\u201d plot looks like this: (1) replicates cluster; and (2) there\u2019s some separation of biological groups.</p> </li> <li> <p>Boxplots. These are very simple: you take all the expression measurements in each sample and dump them into a boxplot, one boxplot for each sample. A ``good\u201d set of plots looks like this: the boxplots are lined up, without much movement between them.</p> </li> <li> <p>RLE plots. These are the same as boxplots but with one extra (crucial) step: subtracting the row median from each row before dumping the observations into boxplots. This additional step removes the between-gene variation, making the plot more sensitive than boxplots for detecting technical variation. A ``good\u201d plot looks like this: the boxplot medians are lined up around zero and the boxes are roughly the same size.</p> </li> </ol> <p>If any of these plots don\u2019t look ``good\u201d, in the ways described, this indicates the presence of technical variation. </p> <p>Let\u2019s make each plot then discuss them: <pre><code># log transform counts, note: 1/2 offset to avoid log transforming zeros\ny &lt;- log2(dge$counts + 1/2)\n\n# PCA plot (nice ggplot version, potentially for publication)\npca &lt;- prcomp(t(y), center=TRUE) \nautoplot(pca, data.frame(group=group), col='group', size=4) + \n  theme_classic() +\n  ggtitle(\"PCA plot\")\n</code></pre> <pre><code># boxplot and RLE plot (simple base R versions; they're generally not for publication)\npar(mfcol=c(1,2))\ncols.group &lt;- group\nlevels(cols.group) &lt;- hue_pal()(4)\n\nboxplot(y, col=as.character(cols.group), outline=FALSE, las=2, cex.axis=0.6, main=\"Boxplots\")\n\nRLE &lt;- y - rowMedians(y)\nboxplot(RLE, col=as.character(cols.group), outline=FALSE, las=2, cex.axis=0.6, main=\"RLE plot\")\nabline(h=0, col=\"grey20\", lwd=3, lty=1)\n</code></pre></p> <p>Note that we made these plots with log transformed counts, not the counts themselves (the reason for this is technical: the log transformation roughly removes the strong mean-variance relationship inherent in RNA-seq data, something we don\u2019t want driving our visualisations). </p> <p>For our data, the PCA plot looks okay; the replicates cluster reasonably well and there\u2019s separation of biological groups. The boxplots and RLE plot, on the other hand, tell a different story (which is why you should visualise your data multiple ways!). The boxplots are wobbling around a little, which is a problem. Indeed, the RLE plot reveals things are far from ideal. The boxplots and RLE plot clearly indicate the presence of technical variation which needs to be removed if we\u2019re to obtain non-rubbish results. This is the topic we turn to next.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/rna-seq-lcg/#basic-normalisation","title":"Basic normalisation","text":"<p>Unfortunately, when doing RNA-seq analysis we can\u2019t simply compare counts between samples because there\u2019s almost always technical differences between them. To make samples properly comparable, the data needs to be normalised: we need to remove or adjust for technical differences between samples, leaving only biological differences (the thing we\u2019re interested in!). Failing to successfully normalise your data can lead to significant missed and/or false discoveries (rubbish results).</p> <p>Two important technical differences between samples are (1) library size differences and (2) compositional differences:</p> <ol> <li>Library size differences. To see the problem here look at Gene 3 in the made up table of counts:</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>Does Gene 3 show a biological or technical difference between the two groups? Looks like a biological difference, but what if I told you the library sizes for group B were 3 times bigger? In that case, the difference looks more like an artifact of library size rather than a true biological difference. Let\u2019s look at the problem another way:</p> <p></p> <p>It should be clear from this that differences resulting from different library sizes can be mistaken for biological differences. One simple way to (roughly) normalise for library size differences is to calculate counts-per-million (CPM). If we again let \\(Y_{ij}\\) be the count for gene \\(i\\) in sample \\(j\\), and let \\(N_j\\) be the library size for sample \\(j\\), then the CPM value for gene \\(i\\) in sample \\(j\\) is given by</p> \\[ \\text{CPM}_{ij} = \\frac{Y_{ij}}{N_j} \\times 10^6 = \\frac{\\text{Count}}{\\text{Library size}} \\times 10^6, \\] <p>Because CPM values are (scaled) proportions, i.e. \u201cCount / Library size\u201d, not absolute counts, the issue of library size differences is no longer relevant.</p> <ol> <li>Compositional differences. For each sample, the probability of sequencing a transcript is proportional to its abundance\u2014this is the basis of how RNA-seq works (of course!). To see the potential problem this fact creates, look at this figure:</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>These two samples are the same (they have the same number of red, yellow, blue, and green transcripts) except for the black transcript: sample A has many more black transcripts. This difference in composition means that even if the library sizes are the same, comparing raw counts still gives the wrong impression. One popular approach for normalising out these differences is the <code>TMM</code> method (from the <code>edgeR</code> package).</p> <p>Here\u2019s how to adjust for library size and compositional differences in our example: <pre><code>dge &lt;- calcNormFactors(dge, method=\"TMM\") # adjustment factors for composition; stored in our container for later use\nCPM &lt;- cpm(dge) # adjustment factors for composition incorporated when calculating cpm values\nhead(CPM) # compare to the raw counts\n</code></pre></p> <p>Before we can proceed, however, we need to do something very important: we need to check that the normalisation methodology we\u2019ve applied has actually worked! One way of doing this is through visualisation. You want to see that the normalisation has (1) removed technical (unwanted) variation, while (2) retaining (i.e. not removing) the biological differences of interest. For example, here\u2019s what our data looks like after normalising for library size and composition: <pre><code># log transform adjusted CPM values\ny &lt;- cpm(dge, log=TRUE)\n\n# PCA plot (nice ggplot version, potentially for publication)\npca &lt;- prcomp(t(y), center=TRUE) \nautoplot(pca, data.frame(group=group), col='group', size=4) + \n  theme_classic() +\n  ggtitle(\"PCA plot\")\n</code></pre> <pre><code># boxplot and RLE plot (simple base R versions; they're generally not for publication)\npar(mfcol=c(1,2))\ncols.group &lt;- group\nlevels(cols.group) &lt;- hue_pal()(4)\n\nboxplot(y, col=as.character(cols.group), outline=FALSE, las=2, cex.axis=0.6, main=\"Boxplots\")\n\nRLE &lt;- y - rowMedians(y)\nboxplot(RLE, col=as.character(cols.group), outline=FALSE, las=2, cex.axis=0.6, main=\"RLE plot\")\nabline(h=0, col=\"grey20\", lwd=3, lty=1)\n</code></pre></p> <p>Note that we can now use the cpm function to calculate logged data. The PCA plot looks better: the replicates are clustered more tightly (technical variation has been removed), and the biological groups are more separated (biological differences between groups are maintained, actually improved). Moreover, the boxplots and RLE plot are looking much better: the boxplots are lined up, and the RLE plot medians are centered on zero and the boxes are roughly similar in size.</p> <p>WARNING!\u2026library size and composition differences aren\u2019t the only kinds of technical differences that can arise between samples:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Another way they can arise is when different samples are prepared differently, e.g.</p> </li> <li> <p>with different protocols, or</p> </li> <li>in different labs, or</li> <li>on different dates, or</li> <li>by different people, or</li> <li>etc.</li> </ul> <p>These differences can lead to so-called \u201cbatch effects\u201d. For example, consider these PCA plots of a real data set:</p> <p></p> <p>These are both the \u201csame\u201d PCA plot, but one is coloured by biological condition and the other is coloured by batch. The major factor driving separation (along PC1) is batch, not biological condition; consequently, replicates are not clustering by group, and the groups aren\u2019t separating. Batch effects like these can only be corrected with more sophisticated analysis approaches, a topic outside the scope of this workshop. </p> <ul> <li>Moreover, batch effects aren\u2019t the only way problems can arise (beyond library size and composition). For example, consider this PCA plot of another real data set (coloured by biological condition):</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Again, the replicates aren\u2019t really clustering and the groups aren\u2019t really separating. The problem here, however, isn\u2019t batch effects\u2014it\u2019s something much more subtle.</p> <p>The bottom line is this: if, after normalising for library size and composition, your visualisations don\u2019t look reasonably \u201cgood\u201d, in the ways discussed above, the results you\u2019ll get from proceeding with a DE analysis will likely contain missed and/or false discoveries\u2014you\u2019ll likely get rubbish results.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/rna-seq-lcg/#differential-expression-limma","title":"Differential expression: limma","text":""},{"location":"tutorials/rna-seq-lcg/#statistical-model-for-the-data","title":"Statistical model (for the data)","text":"<p>Let\u2019s remind ourselves of our goal.

The details are there partly for completeness, but mostly to help demystify design matrices: they\u2019re just something that connects your data (observed expression values) to the things of interest, in our case the means of the groups. The design matrix is easy to make using our <code>group</code> factor vector: <pre><code>X &lt;- model.matrix(~0 + group) # note the \"0\": VERY important!\ncolnames(X) &lt;- levels(group)\nX\n</code></pre> Observe, of course, that this is the same as the design matrix above. Fitting the linear model is easy too: <pre><code>fit &lt;- lmFit(y, design=X)\nnames(fit)\nhead(fit$coefficients)\n</code></pre> We\u2019ve arrived at the group means for each gene, but this isn\u2019t what we\u2019re really after: what we really want are differences between the group means\u2014remember: we\u2019re looking for DE genes\u2014or, more precisely, we want differences between the group means for contrasts (i.e. comparisons) of interest. To do this, we construct the contrasts of interest and then fit them. For example, suppose we\u2019re interested in two comparisons: (1) RA vs WT (i.e. the effect of RA), and (2) TGFb vs WT (i.e. the effect of TGFb). The corresponding contrast (matrix) is constructed as follows: <pre><code>CM &lt;- makeContrasts(\n  RA_WT   = RA - WT,\n  TGFb_WT = TGFb - WT,\n  levels=X)\nCM\n</code></pre> Now, to calculate these contrasts, i.e. to fit them, we do the following: <pre><code>fit2 &lt;- contrasts.fit(fit, contrasts=CM)\nhead(fit2$coefficients)\n</code></pre> This has transformed the initial coefficients (i.e. groups means) into the contrasts of interest: the difference in means between the RA and WT groups (column 1) and the difference in means between the TGFb and WT groups (column 2).</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/rna-seq-lcg/#testing-for-de","title":"Testing for DE","text":"<p>Now that we have our differences in group means for each gene, we want to ask if any of these differences are significantly different from zero (over and above what you might see by random chance). In other words, for each gene we want to statistically test if the means of the two groups are different\u2014more simply: we want to test for DE! To do this, we\u2019ll use the so-called t-test (applied to each gene), whose test statistic looks like this:</p> \\[ T = \\frac{\\bar{y}_{_{A}} - \\bar{y}_{_{B}}}{ \\sqrt{v}} \\] <p>where \\(\\bar{y}_{_{A}}\\) and \\(\\bar{y}_{_{B}}\\) are the means of the two groups being compared, and \\(v\\) is an estimate of the variance. To test the null hypothesis (that the means are the same), we use the \\(t\\)-distribution to calculate probabilities about this test statistic (if the chances of seeing certain values of \\(T\\) are small, this is evidence against the null hypothesis that the group means are the same).</p> <p>At this point you must be thinking: \u201cwhy did we do all that linear models stuff if, in the end, we\u2019re just going to use a t-test?\u201d There are at least two reasons. Briefly:</p> <ol> <li>By using a linear model we\u2019ve actually used all the samples to estimate the variability \\(v\\) here (a standard t-test would only estimate it from the two groups being compared) and so the estimate is better.</li> <li>Linear models are much more powerful than our simple situation suggests: they can be used to easily adjust for things which aren\u2019t of interest but affect the things of interest, e.g. you can make comparisons while adjusting for biological things (e.g. sex) or while adjusting for technical things (e.g. batch), or while adjusting for both!</li> </ol> <p>Hopefully this convinces you that linear models are your friend, but now you must be thinking a different question: \u201cwait a second\u2026we\u2019re going to do t-tests with as little as 2 or 3 observations in each group?\u2026that\u2019s crazy!\u201d Yes, that does seem crazy\u2014there\u2019s barely any information in each group to make a reliable inference about whether the means are different. But this is where the real magic of RNA-seq analysis comes in, the thing that makes it all work: empirical Bayes statistics. The full details are beyond the scope of our discussion, but the rough idea is this: we use a procedure whereby the genes are allowed to share information with each other\u2014this sharing of information between genes makes up for the fact that there isn\u2019t much information within any single gene. This procedure is applied to the gene variances\u2014the \\(v\\)\u2019s above\u2014which moderates them, making them better estimates, and thus increasing our power to detect DE (other terms for this \u2018moderation\u2019 procedure include \u2018shrinkage\u2019 or \u2018regularization\u2019, terms which you may see in your travels\u2014this powerful technique is used in many places in statistical omics analysis). So, the statistic used to test for DE is actually:</p> \\[ \\widetilde{T} = \\frac{\\bar{y}_{_{A}} - \\bar{y}_{_{B}}}{ \\sqrt{ \\widetilde{v} }} \\] <p>where \\(\\widetilde{v}\\) is the moderated variance; accordingly, \\(\\widetilde{T}\\) is called the \u201cmoderated t-statistic\u201d.</p> <p>That said, testing for DE with the moderated t-statistic is actually easy: <pre><code>fit2 &lt;- eBayes(fit2, trend=TRUE) # \"eBayes\" means empirical Bayes\nnames(fit2) # note the addition of \"t\" (and other empirical Bayes things, which needn't concern us)\n</code></pre> NOTE. We\u2019ve specified the function option <code>trend=TRUE</code> (this isn\u2019t default). This is because one characteristic of RNA-seq data is that there is a downward trend in variability as a function of the level of expression\u2014genes with lower levels of expression are more variable than genes with higher levels of expression (see next section). The empirical Bayes procedure takes this trend into account.</p> <p>There\u2019s a fair amount of differential expression\u2014here\u2019s the number of DE genes for each comparison: <pre><code>dt &lt;- decideTests(fit2)\nsummary(dt)\n</code></pre></p>"},{"location":"tutorials/rna-seq-lcg/#some-checks","title":"Some checks","text":"<p>Before we look at the DE results more closely, there\u2019s some things we need to check:</p> <ol> <li>SA plot. This is a plot of variability (estimated by the linear model) as a function of expression level. It typically has a characteristic shape: it (monotonically) trends downward.</li> <li>MD plot (for each comparison). This is simply a plot of log-fold-change (y-axis) and expression level (x-axis) for all genes. The meaning of \u2018log-fold-change\u2019 will be discussed below. For now, we note that these plots should look as follows: (1) the \u2018cloud\u2019 of data is skewered through the middle, (2) the red/blue dots are on top/bottom, respectively, and in roughly the same proportions (unless you have a reason to think otherwise), and (3) there\u2019s a characteristic funnel shape, thicker to thinner as expression level increases. </li> <li>p-value histogram (for each comparison). This is simply a histogram of all the DE hypothesis test p-values (one p-value for each gene). It should look like this: flat, with a possible spike on the far left. The intuitive idea here is simple: a large majority of genes aren\u2019t DE, i.e. the null hypothesis is true for then, and so testing them for DE should just produce p-values that are random noise between 0-1, and thus a the histogram of these p-values should be flat; the possible spike to the far left are p-values from genes which are truly DE.</li> </ol> <p>These are made as follows: <pre><code>plotSA(fit2)\n</code></pre> <pre><code>par(mfcol=c(1,2))\nplotMD(fit2, coef=\"RA_WT\", status=dt[,\"RA_WT\"], cex=0.6, main=\"MD-plot: RA vs WT\")\nabline(h=0, lwd=2, col=\"green2\")\nplotMD(fit2, coef=\"TGFb_WT\", status=dt[,\"TGFb_WT\"], cex=0.6, main=\"MD-plot: TGFb vs WT\")\nabline(h=0, lwd=2, col=\"green2\")\n</code></pre> <pre><code>par(mfcol=c(1,2))\nhist(fit2$p.value[,\"RA_WT\"], col=\"grey\", xlab=\"p-value\", main=\"p-value histogram: RA vs WT\")\nhist(fit2$p.value[,\"TGFb_WT\"], col=\"grey\", xlab=\"p-value\", main=\"p-value histogram: TGFb vs WT\")\n</code></pre></p> <p>These visualisations look as they should in this case.

Depending on how bad they look, the results will likely contain missed and/or false discoveries\u2014they\u2019ll be rubbish. The p-value histograms are particularly important. Consider two real examples from different data sets below:</p> <p></p> <p>The plot on the right is ideal, i.e. flat with possible spike to the left. The plot on the left is far from ideal.

Firstly, in our context, we\u2019re doing ~10,000 hypothesis tests, and so the idea of a p-value isn\u2019t particularly useful. To appreciate this, consider the following xkcd comic:</p> <p></p> <p>Recall that the p-value is the probability of seeing certain values of our test statistic, assuming the null hypothesis is true, and that we reject the null assumption if the calculated probability is small, say, below 0.05. But, this implies the following: if we were testing 10,000 genes, and the null hypothesis was true for every gene (i.e. there was no DE in the data set), then we\u2019d still reject the null (i.e. infer DE) for ~500 genes\u2014that\u2019s 500 false discoveries! The solution to this problem is to focus on a different idea: the false discovery rate (FDR). This is the proportion of false discoveries of DE amongst all the genes you\u2019ve declared to be DE. This is what the adjusted p-value (adj.P.Val) represents, i.e. if you choose a DE cutoff of adj.P.Val &lt; 0.05 then only 5% of the genes declared DE with this cutoff will be false discoveries.</p> <p>At this point, one extra way of checking your results is to look at any known control genes relevant to the experiment: positive or negative controls, i.e. genes which should or shouldn\u2019t be DE between conditions, respectively. For example, a positive control for this experiment is Hic1 because RA is known to up-regulate this gene\u2014it should be DE in the RA vs WT comparison, and indeed it is: <pre><code>i &lt;- tab1$Symbol==\"Hic1\"\ntab1[i,]\n</code></pre> If it turned out this gene wasn\u2019t DE, this would cast some doubt over the validity of the analysis.</p> <p>Finally, let\u2019s save our results in an Excel spreadsheet!: <pre><code>write.xlsx(tab1, file=\"../Results/DE_RA-vs-WT.xlsx\")\nwrite.xlsx(tab2, file=\"../Results/DE_TGFb-vs-WT.xlsx\")\n</code></pre></p>"},{"location":"tutorials/rna-seq-lcg/#two-limma-approaches-trend-vs-voom","title":"Two limma approaches: \u201ctrend\u201d vs \u201cvoom\u201d","text":"<p>Recall that there\u2019s two flavours of <code>limma</code>: <code>trend</code> and <code>voom</code>.

The difference between Cuffmerge and Cuffcompare is     that if we have two transfrags A and B, Cuffcompare only combines     the two where either A or B is \u2018contained\u2019 in the other transfrag or     in other words one of them is redundant; whereas Cuffmerge assembles     them if they overlap with each other and agree on splicing.</p> <p>[^3]: Since CummRbund is currently not installed on Galaxy, the     underlying steps are not included in this tutorial; instead we use     IGV (Robinson et al 2011) and Trackster for visualizing the output     which are accessible from Galaxy.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/rna_seq_dge_basic/rna_seq_basic_tutorial/","title":"RNAseq analysis using HISAT2 (Galaxy)","text":""},{"location":"tutorials/rna_seq_dge_basic/rna_seq_basic_tutorial/#rna-seq-differential-gene-expression","title":"RNA-Seq - Differential Gene Expression","text":"<p>Authors: Jessica Chung, Mahtab Mirmomeni, Andrew Lonie</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/rna_seq_dge_basic/rna_seq_basic_tutorial/#tutorial-overview","title":"Tutorial Overview","text":"<p>In this tutorial we cover the concepts of RNA-seq differential gene expression (DGE) analysis using a dataset from the common fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster.</p> <p>The tutorial is designed to introduce the tools, datatypes and workflows of an RNA-seq DGE analysis.

You should see the characteristic distribution of RNA-seq reads across     the exons of the genes, with some gaps at intron/exon boundaries.     The number of reads aligned to a particular gene is proportional to the     abundance of the RNA derived from that gene in the sequenced sample.

Then open     the saved .bed file directly in IGV using the File &gt; Load From File     option from IGV. This is because IGV doesn\u2019t automatically stream BED     files from Galaxy.          The junctions file is loaded at the bottom of the     IGV window and splicing events are represented as coloured arcs. The     height and thickness of the arcs are proportional to the read depth.</li> <li> <p>View differentially expressed genes by viewing two alignment files     simultaneously. The aim of this tutorial is to statistically test     differential expression, but first it\u2019s useful to reassure ourselves     that the data looks right at this stage by comparing the aligned reads     for condition 1 (C1) and condition 2 (C2).</p> <p>Select \u2018TopHat on data 4: accepted_hits\u2019 (this is the accepted hits alignment file from first replicate of condition C2) and click on \u2018display with IGV local\u2019.

One the file has loaded, change the location to chr4:325197-341887 using the field on the top toolbar.</p> <p>The middle gene in this area clearly looks like it has many more reads mapped in condition 2 than condition 1, whereas for the surrounding genes the reads look about the same. The middle gene looks like it is differentially expressed. But, of course, it may be that there are many more reads in the readsets for C1 and C2, and the other genes are underexpressed in condition 2. So we need to statistically normalise the read counts before we can say anything definitive, which we will do in the next section.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"tutorials/rna_seq_dge_basic/rna_seq_basic_tuxedo/#4-optional-visualise-the-aligned-reads-in-trackster","title":"4.

This means we get a huge number of observations for a small number of samples. For example, the expression of ~20,000 genes could be measured for 6 samples (3 knock-out and 3 wild-type). A frequently used approach to analyse RNA-seq data is to fit each gene to a linear model where for each of the 20,000 genes, parameters need to be estimated using a small number of observations. To complicate matters, each measurement of gene expression is comprised of a mix of biological signal and unwanted noise. Thus, in order to perform a robust statistical analysis, the methodology must be carefully designed.</p> <p>Before you begin any RNA-seq experiment, some questions you should ask yourself are:</p> <ul> <li>Why do you expect to find differentially expressed genes in the particular    tissue?</li> <li>What types of genes do you expect to find differentially expressed?</li> <li>What are the sources of variability from your samples?</li> <li>Where do you expect most of your variation to come from?</li> </ul> <p>A coherent experimental design is the groundwork of a successful experiment. You should invest time and thought in designing a robust experiment as failing to think this step through can lead to unusable data and wasted time, money, and effort.</p> <p>It is also useful to think about the statistical methods you will use to analyse the data. If you\u2019re planning to bring a data analyst or bioinformatician onboard for data analysis, you should include him or her in the experimental design stage.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/rna_seq_exp_design/rna_seq_experimental_design/#terminology","title":"Terminology","text":"<p>Before progressing, it may be useful to define some terms which are commonly used in RNA-seq.</p> Variability:     A measure of how much the data is spread around. Variance is     mathematically defined as the average of the squared difference between     observations and the expected value. Simply put, a larger variance means     it is harder to identify differentially expressed genes.    Feature:     A defined genomic region. Usually a gene in RNA-seq, but can also     refer to any region such as an exon or an isoform. In RNA-seq, an estimate     of abundance is obtained for each feature.    Biological replicates:     Samples that have been obtained from biologically separate samples.     This can mean different individual organisms (e.g. tissue samples from     different mice), different samplings of the same tumour, or different     population of cells grown separately from each other but originating from     the same cell-line. For example, the samples obtained from three different     knock-out mice could be considered biological replicates in a knock-out     versus wild-type experiment. A biological replicate combines both technical     and biological variability as it is also an independent case of all the     technical steps.    Technical replicates:     Samples in which the starting biological sample is the same, but the     replicates are processed separately. For example, if a biological sample     is divided and two different library preps are processed and sequenced,     those two samples would be considered technical replicates.    Covariate:     The term 'covariate' is often used interchangeably with 'factor' or     'variable' in RNA-seq. The term refers to a property of the sample which     may have some influence on gene expression and should be represented in     the RNA-seq model. Covariates in RNA-seq are often categorical (e.g.     treatment condition, sex, batch), but continuous factors are also possible     (e.g. time points, age). A linear model will contain terms to represent     the relationships between covariates and each sample. Each possible value     a factor can take is called a level (e.g. 'male' and 'female' are two     levels in the factor 'sex'). Factors can either be directly of interest     to the experiment (e.g. treatment condition) or not of interest (also     known as nuisance variables) (e.g. sex, batch). The purpose of covariates     is to explain the variance seen in samples.    Confounding variable:     A confounding variable is a nuisance variable that is associated with     the factor of interest. Possible confounding factors should be controlled     for so they don't interfere with analysis. For example, if all knock-out     mice samples were harvested in the morning and all wild-type mice samples     were harvested in the afternoon, the time of sample collection would be a     confounding factor as the effects from sample collection time and from the     knock-out cannot be separated.    Statistical power:     The ability to identify differentially expressed genes when there     really is a difference. This is partly dependent on variance and therefore     is affected by the number of replicates available and sequencing depth."},{"location":"tutorials/rna_seq_exp_design/rna_seq_experimental_design/#the-importance-of-replicates-to-estimate-variance","title":"The importance of replicates to estimate variance","text":"<p>When performing a differential gene expression analysis, we look at the expression values of each gene and try to determine if the expression is significantly different in the different conditions (e.g. knock-out and wild-type). The ability to distinguish whether a gene is differentially expressed is partly determined by the estimates of variability obtained by using multiple observations in each condition.</p> <p>Variability is present in two forms: technical variability and biological variability.</p> <p>Combined biological and technical variability is measured using biological replicates. Biological variability is the main source of variability and is due to natural variation in the population and within cells. This includes different individuals having different levels of a particular gene and the stochastic nature of expression levels in different cells.</p> <p>Technical variability is measured using technical replicates. Technical variability is often very small compared to biological variability.  Usually the question is whether an observed difference is greater than the total variability (i.e. significant).  As combined variability is measured by biological replicates technical replicates are only important if you need to know the degree of biological variability or technical variability.  An example of wanting technical variability would be method development. The main source of technical variation comes from RNA processing and from library prep. Variability from sequencing in different flow cells or different lanes is usually minimal. Generally, creating technical replicates from multiple library preps is unnecessary for RNA-seq experiments.</p> <p>The amount of variance between your biological replicates will affect the outcome of your analysis. Ideally, you aim to have minimal variability between samples so you only measure the effect of the condition of interest. Too much variability between samples can drown out the signal of truly differentially expressed genes. Controlling for possible confounding factors between conditions is also important to prevent falsely attributing differential expression to the condition of interest.</p> <p>Strategies to minimise variation between samples and to control confounding variables include:</p> <ul> <li>choosing organisms from the same litter,</li> <li>choosing organisms of the same sex if possible,</li> <li>using a constant sample collection time,</li> <li>having the same laboratory technician perform each library prep,</li> <li>randomising samples to prevent a confounding batch effect if all samples    can\u2019t be processed at one time.</li> </ul> <p>If variation between samples can not be removed it should be balanced between conditions of interest as much as possible, and carefully recorded to allow its effect to be measured and potentially removed during analysis.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/rna_seq_exp_design/rna_seq_experimental_design/#how-many-replicates-and-how-many-reads-do-i-need","title":"How many replicates and how many reads do I need?","text":"<p>Two very common question asked are:</p> <ul> <li>how many biological replicates do I need, and</li> <li>what sequencing depth is needed for each sample</li> </ul> <p>in order to have enough statistical power for my RNA-seq experiment?</p> <p>These questions cannot be precisely answered without a pilot study. A small amount of data (minimum of two biological replicates for each condition with at least 10M reads) can estimate the amount of biological variation, which determines how many biological replicates are required. Performing a pilot study is highly recommended to estimate statistical power and identify possible problems before investing more time and money into the project.</p> <p>Scotty is a web-based tool that uses data generated from a pilot study to optimize a design for statistical power. With a limited budget, one must balance sequence coverage and number of biological replicates. Scotty also has a cost estimate feature which returns the most powerful design within budget constraints.</p> <p>As a general rule, the number of biological replicates should never be below 3. For a basic RNA-seq differential expression experiment, 10M to 20M reads per sample is usually enough.  If similar data exists it can be helpful to check the read counts for key genes of interest to estimate the required depth.</p> <p>Biological variability is usually the largest effect limiting the power of RNA-seq analysis.  The most improvement in an experiment will usually be achieved by increasing the biological replication to improve estimation of the biological variation.</p> <p>It is often possible to design experiments where the analysis is done incrementally such that a pilot study is added to with an additional block of samples or a pool of libraries is sequenced to additional depth. In these cases care must be taken to balance the design in a manner that each stage is a valid experiment in its own right.  This can allow a focused question to be answered in the first stage, with an ability to either address issues or progress to a second stage with additional questions.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/rna_seq_exp_design/rna_seq_experimental_design/#sequencing-options-to-consider","title":"Sequencing options to consider","text":"<p>How much total RNA is needed: Many sequencing centres such as AGRF recommend at least 250ng of total RNA for RNA sequencing. It is possible to go as low as 100ng of total RNA, but results are not guaranteed. The quality of RNA is also important when making libraries. A RNA Integrity Number (RIN) is a number from 1 (poor) to 10 (good) and can indicate how much degradation there is in the sample. A poor score can lead to over representation at the 3\u2019 end of the transcript and low yield. Samples with low RIN scores (below 8) are not recommended for sequencing.  Care should also be taken to ensure RIN is consistent between conditions to avoid confounding this technical effect with the biological question.</p> <p>Choosing an enrichment method: Ribosomal RNA makes up &gt;95% of total cellular RNA, so a preparation for RNA-seq must either enrich for mRNA using poly-A enrichment, or deplete rRNA. Poly-A enrichment is recommended for most standard RNA-seq experiments, but will not provide information about microRNAs and other non-coding RNA species. In general, ribo-depleted RNA-seq data will contain more noise, however, the protocol is recommended if you have poor or variable quality of RNA as the 3\u2019 bias of poly-A enrichment will be more pronounced with increased RNA degradation. The amount of RNA needed for each method differs. For Poly-A enrichment a minimum of 100ng is needed while for ribo-depletion, a minimum of 200ng is recommended.</p> <p>Choosing read type: For basic differential expression analysis RNA-seq experiments, single-end sequencing is recommended to obtain gene transcript counts. In more advanced experiments, paired-ends are useful for determining transcript structure and discovering splice variants.</p> <p>Choosing strandedness: </p> <p>With a non-directional (unstranded) protocol, there is no way to identify whether a read originated from the coding strand or its reverse complement. Non-directional protocols allow mapping of a read to a genomic location, but not the direction in which the RNA was transcribed. They are therefore used to count transcripts for known genes, and are recommended for basic RNA-seq experiments. Directional protocols (stranded) preserve strand information and are useful for novel transcript discovery.</p> <p>Multiplexing: Multiplexing is an approach to sequence multiple samples in the same sequencing lane. By sequencing all samples in the same lane, multiplexing can also minimise bias from lane effects.</p> <p>Spike-in controls: RNA-seq spike-in controls are a set of synthetic RNAs of known concentration which act as negative or positive controls. These controls have been used for normalisation and quality control, but recent work has shown that the amount of technical variability in their use dramatically reduces their utility.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/rna_seq_exp_design/rna_seq_experimental_design/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"<ul> <li>A good experimental design is vital for a successful experiment.

To use OpenSSH you must  first start a terminal program on your computer.  On OS X the standard terminal is called Terminal, and it is installed by default.  On Linux there are many popular terminal programs including: xterm, gnome-terminal, konsole (if you aren't sure, then xterm is a good  default).  When you've started the terminal you should see a command prompt.  To log into *barcoo*, for example, type this command at  the prompt and press return (where the word *username* is replaced with your *barcoo* username):  *$ ssh username@barcoo.vlsci.org.au*  The same procedure works for any other machine where you have an account except that if your Unix computer uses a port other than 22 you will need to specify the port by adding the option *-p PORT* with PORT substituted with the port number.  You may be presented with a message along the lines of:  <pre><code>The authenticity of host 'barcoo.vlsci.org.au (131.172.36.150)' can't be  established.\n...\nAre you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?\n</code></pre>  Although you should never ignore a warning, this particular one is nothing to be concerned about; type **yes** and then **press enter**.  If all goes well you will be asked to enter your password.  Assuming you type the correct username and password the system should  then display a welcome message, and then present you with a Unix prompt.  If you get this far then you are ready to start entering  Unix commands and thus begin using the remote computer.   Windows  On Microsoft Windows (Vista, 7, 8) we recommend that you use the PuTTY ssh client.  PuTTY (putty.exe) can be downloaded  from this web page:  [http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html)  Documentation for using PuTTY is here:  [http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/docs.html](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/docs.html)  When you start PuTTY you should see a window which looks something like this:    To connect to *barcoo* you should enter *barcoo.vlsci.org.au* into the box entitled \"Host Name (or IP address)\"  and *22* in the port,  then click on the Open button. All of the settings should remain the same as they were when PuTTY started (which should be the  same as they are in the picture above).  In some circumstances you will be presented with a window entitled PuTTY Security Alert. It will say something along the lines  of *\"The server's host key is not cached in the registry\"*. This is nothing to worry about, and you should agree to continue (by  clicking on Yes). You usually see this message the first time you try to connect to a particular remote computer.  If all goes well, a terminal window will open, showing a prompt with the text *\"login as:\"*. An example terminal window is shown  below. You should type your *barcoo* username and press enter. After entering your username you will be prompted for your  password. Assuming you type the correct username and password the system should then display a welcome message, and then  present you with a Unix prompt. If you get this far then you are ready to start entering Unix commands and thus begin using  the remote computer.   <p>Note: for security reasons ssh will not display any characters when you enter your password. This can be confusing because it appears as if your typing is not recognised by the computer. Don\u2019t be alarmed; type your password in and press return at the end.</p> <p>barcoo is a high performance computer for Melbourne Bioinformatics users.  Logging in connects your local computer (e.g. laptop) to barcoo, and allows you to type commands into the Unix prompt which are run on the HPC, and have the results displayed on your local screen.</p> <p>You will be allocated a training account on barcoo for the duration of the workshop. Your username and password will be supplied at the start of the workshop.</p> <p>Log out of barcoo, and log back in again (to make sure you can repeat the process).</p> <p>All the remaining parts assume that you are logged into barcoo over ssh.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/unix_archive_2022/unix/#exercises","title":"Exercises","text":""},{"location":"tutorials/unix_archive_2022/unix/#11-when-youve-logged-into-the-unix-server-run-the-following-commands-and-see-what-they-do","title":"1.1) When you\u2019ve logged into the Unix server, run the following commands and see what they do:","text":"<ul> <li>who</li> <li>whoami</li> <li>date</li> <li>cal</li> <li>hostname</li> <li>/vlsci/TRAINING/shared/Intro_to_Unix/hi</li> </ul> Answer  * **who**: displays a list of the users who are currently using this Unix computer. * **whoami**: displays your username (i.e. they person currently logged in). * **date**: displays the current date and time. * **cal**: displays a calendar on the terminal.

You will see a list of files and directories in the parent directory of your home directory. One of them will be the name of your home directory, something like *trainXX*.  Where *XX* is replaced by a two digit string.  **Altername**: using the *-a* flag and looking at the *.* (dot) special file.  <pre><code>$ ls -la\n...\ndrwxr-x--- 4 trainingXY training  512 Feb  9 14:18 .\n...\n</code></pre>   **Answer**: *drwxr-x---*  * **You**: read (see filenames), write (add, delete files), execute (change your CWD to this directory). * **Training users**: read, execute * **Everyone else**: No access  **Discussion on Permissions**:  The permission string is *\"drwxr-x---\"*. The *d* means it is a directory. The *rwx* means that the owner of the directory (your user account) can *read*, *write* and *execute* the directory. Execute permissions on a directory means that you can *cd* into the directory. The *r-x* means that anyone in the same user group as *training* can read or execute the directory. The *---* means that nobody else (other users on the system) can do anything with the directory.   <p>man is for manual: and it will be your best friend!</p> <p>Manual pages include a lot of detail about a command and its available flags/options.

Exit-status: It is a Unix standard that when the user provides incorrect commandline arguments we print a usage message and return a *non-zero* exit status.

It is designed to help you keep track of collections of files which stem from a common source and undergo modifications over time. The files tend to be human generated text. It is very good at managing source code repositories, but it can also be used to manage other things, such as configuration files and text documents. It is not, however, a file backup system.</p> <p>Git encourages a distributed style of project development. Each contributor to a project has their own complete repository. Changes are shared between repositories by pushing changes to, or pulling changes from other repositories. Collaboration between developers is greatly enhanced by websites such as github, bitbucket and gitorious which provide convenient interfaces to managing multiple repositories.</p> <p>There are many alternatives to git which each have their pros and cons. Two of the more popular alternatives are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Subversion is particularly suited to a centralised model of development.</p> </li> <li> <p>Mercurial is very similar to Git, but is sometimes considered more user friendly.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"tutorials/using_git/Using_Git/#getting-help","title":"Getting help","text":"<p>There are lots of resources on the web for learning how to use Git.

Since we usually have (at least) millions of reads, it becomes computationally too expensive to compare reads to one another - instead, high-throughput aligners such as Bowtie align each read individually to the reference genome.</p> <p>This is often a problem where indels are present, as the aligner will be reluctant to align a read over an indel without sufficient evidence. This can lead to misalignment and to false positive SNVs. We can improve the performance of variant callers by carrying out a further step of \u2018realignment\u2019 after the initial alignment, considering all the reads in a particular genomic region collectively. In particular, this can provide enough collective evidence to realign reads correctly over suspected indels.</p> <p>Both GATK and FreeBayes will benefit from local realignment around indels.

Here we will go through the Convolutional Neural Net based protocol to annotate and filter the VCF file.</p> <p>This is a two step process:</p> <p>(i) CNNScoreVariants will annotate the variant with pre-computed single-sample derived model scores in the INFO field CNN_1D (the neural network performs convolutions over the reference sequence surrounding the variant and combines those features with a multilayer perceptron on the variant annotations).</p> <pre><code>gatk --java-options \"-Xmx7g\" CNNScoreVariants  \\\n   -R reference/hg38/Homo_sapiens_assembly38.fasta \\\n   -V output/output.vcf.gz \\\n   -O output/output.cnns.vcf\n</code></pre> <p>(ii) FilterVariantTranches takes as input the percent sensitivities (0-100) to known sites to apply the filter. Variants with scores higher than for e.g. 99<sup>th</sup> percentile of variants in the resources pass through the filter and will have <code>PASS</code> in the filter. Others will have a filter values like \u2018CNN_1D_INDEL_Tranche_99.40_100.00\u2019 or \u2018CNN_1D_SNP_Tranche_99.95_100.00\u2019.</p> <pre><code>gatk --java-options \"-Xmx7g\" FilterVariantTranches \\\n    -V output/output.cnns.vcf \\\n    --resource reference/hg38/hapmap_3.3.hg38.vcf.gz \\\n    --resource reference/hg38/Mills_and_1000G_gold_standard.indels.hg38.vcf.gz \\\n    --info-key CNN_1D \\\n    --snp-tranche 99.95 \\\n    --indel-tranche 99.4 \\\n    -O output/output.cnns.cnnfilter.vcf\n</code></pre> <p>Hint</p> <p>BCFtools is a useful tool to manipulate, filter and query VCF files.
