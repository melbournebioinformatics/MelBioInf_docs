### Description

*Ever wanted to visualise your own data? You can with R!*

This introduction to R and RStudio will provide beginners with experience with loading, manipulating and visualising biological data using the tidyverse collection of R packages. The example data used is publicly available RNA-seq data, therefore attendees will gain experience in the structure and appearance of RNA-seq data.
This workshop has been developed collaboratively by training specialists at Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre and Melbourne Bioinformatics.

Tools: [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/), [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)

-------------------------------
## Learning Objectives

At the end of this introductory workshop, you will be able to:

*	Load tabular data into R.
*	Apply tidyverse functions to manipulate data in R.
*	Produce simple plots such boxplots using ggplot.
*	Understand and apply data faceting in ggplot.
*	Modify the aesthetics of a ggplot plot.

-------------------------------
## Requirements and preparation

**Attendees are required to bring their own laptop computers to face to face workshops.** <br/>

At least one week before the workshop, participants should install the software and data files below.  This should provide sufficient time for participants to liaise with their own IT support should they encounter any IT problems.  
We recommend you watch this [video](https://resources.rstudio.com/tidyverse/tidyverse-visualisation-manipulation-basics) to familiarise yourself with R, Rstudio and Tidyverse.


### Preparing your laptop prior to starting this workshop
1. Download and install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) (free) on your computer.
2. Download and install [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) (free) on your computer.
3. Detailed instructions for installing R and RStudio are available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Bso4B7_ZxI_7q9K_TVnPoeQIQFK_9TSI/view).

### Required Software
