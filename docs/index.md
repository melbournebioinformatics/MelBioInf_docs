# Welcome to MBITE!

MBITE stands for <u>**M**</u>elbourne <u>**BI**</u>oinformatics <u>**T**</u>raining and <u>**E**</u>ducation. These tutorials have been developed by bioinformaticians at MB, where they are regularly delivered as in-house or online workshops. They are also designed to be used for self-directed learning. Many of the training materials were developed for use on Galaxy Australia, enabling learners to easily transition from learning to doing their own data analysis.

To get updates about or attend our workshops, check out our [Melbourne Bioinformatics Eventbrite page](https://www.eventbrite.com.au/o/melbourne-bioinformatics-13058846490).
